<p>I&rsquo;m going to give doing weeknotes a try. Basically a round up of my week in terms of design and whatnot.</p>

<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Planned out some content changes for our prototype with the content designer. Folded some changes into it. Took a good chunk of the day. Enabled the programme to review content and site structure in preparation for going public.</p>

<p>Wrote a little more on personas for an interaction design course I am cobbling together. Editing it led me to reading <a href="https://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/05/the_origin_of_personas">Alan Cooper&rsquo;s The origin of personas</a>.</p>

<p>Mucked about with a screen recording tools or two in preparation to record the course. In built Mac tools turned out to be the best shout.</p>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Played a &ldquo;silence game&rdquo; imagined up by our delivery manager Sophie to review the product backlog. Worked pretty well. We all agreed she needed to write it up and patent it.</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/silence_game/having_fun.jpg" title="Having fun" alt="Thunderbird team having fun playing the silence game" /></p>

<p>Lent a helping hand later to take a couple of people from GDS on a tour around the Digital Delivery Centre. Talked a little about the way we had evolved our design process on my project to keep it agile and outcome focused.</p>

<p>They raised some interesting points about ensuring that agile teams don&rsquo;t just provide the business with the ability to make decisions, but also help them make the right ones.</p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>Worked from home.</p>

<p>Took some time to design how offline forms are going to work on the service. Explored current solutions used by the NHS Choices website and DVLA.</p>

<p>Reviewed the designs with several other designers. Found out that a colleague is soon to be married in the process (Congratulations Karl! Pizza in the post please).</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t underestimate the value and importance of sharing work early and often.</p>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Very intense day started in a usability lab. An interesting remix on the classic lab with a focus on how contact centre staff would be involved in assisted digital journeys.</p>

<p>Was really impressed with the problem solving from the call centre staff. Guiding users and developing and remixing the call centre scripts.</p>

<p>Made me think about organisations like Automattic that ensure their developers spend a week a year doing phone support. The idea being to keep them humble and aware of the problems being faced by their users day to day. Feels like a concept that would really help designers and developers building software for the NHS too.</p>

<p>Caught up briefly with a graduate I have been mentoring. Talked to his assignment manager too, a product manager on the project he was on. Seemed like a really nice team. Got invited to their next show and tell by the product manager. Will make a special effort to attend.</p>

<p>Asked a question in the design slack and on Twitter about the use of personas. Really interesting debate and discussion. Will write it up soon.</p>

<p>Hosted the design huddle. Heard from the delightful Dean about the &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; work. They&rsquo;re working on foundational elements for the rest of the organisation. Raised the issue of forms and transactional service design. Talked a little about my forms as well.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Had a few more changes and questions from the programme but got all the content approved and ready for public beta!</p>

<p>Chased up the status on the service&rsquo;s offline forms and handed over design and content to the NHSUK migration team, in readiness for the site going live in May.</p>

<p>Inspired a fellow designer to go buy a sausage roll by the mere sight of my stuffing my face with one. The food of champion designers&hellip;</p>

<p>Had a coffee and chat about design at NHS Digital with one of my favourite people, the magnificent Tero!</p>

<p>Had a good catch up.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t get to talk double diamond enough. Need to make sure we don&rsquo;t leave it to goodbyes to talk our favourite subject.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about the Double Diamond for my interaction design course so really should have started with that.</p>
