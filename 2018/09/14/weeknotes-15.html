<p>Trying to keep these even leaner. Going to focus on a few themes from a week.</p>

<h2>Paper forms</h2>

<p>On a personal crusade with paper forms right now. We have three for patients. And soon have some for prisoners (filled in by prison medical staff on behalf of a prisoner).</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not good enough. People can muddle through them. But they&rsquo;re not the standard we need to be hitting.</p>

<p>On the back of a great session at the design huddle with Caroline Jarrett I had a strong action plan. I even tweeted it for feedback:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Any other solid ways of researching paper forms?<br><br>We&rsquo;re doing:<br><br>+ looking at real paper form submissions<br>+ working with team who get forms and action them<br>+ user lab focused on paper forms<br>+ Challenging the need for stuff in the forms üòÅ</p>&mdash; Andrew Duckworth (@AndrewDuck_) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_/status/1039789320792666112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And got even greater feedback and connections to people willing to help.</p>

<p>The programme agreed to do everything to make them better. With a bit of campaigning we&rsquo;ve got access to the current filled in forms and will review them next Wednesday as a team. We&rsquo;ve also booked in a lab and potentially some pop-up testing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a clean form system. Brutally simple graphic design system. Now to make our process brutally simple for our users.</p>

<h2>Design meet up!</h2>

<p>This week it was the quarterly all-hands design meet. In London this time.</p>

<p>I enjoy going to London. That said, though the venue was great, it wasn&rsquo;t as iconic or scenic a walk this time. And it was also a rather painfully long day. Thanks trains!</p>

<p>During the day I got to express my inner artiste:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best name badge I ever did have. Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AndrewDuck_</a> ü¶Ñ <a href="https://t.co/cH2DBkcFRu">pic.twitter.com/cH2DBkcFRu</a></p>&mdash; Louise Mushet (@louisemushet) <a href="https://twitter.com/louisemushet/status/1039883809553084416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And hang with lots of cool people. (Special shout out to Louise Mushet who made the day extra fun without a few of my design besties!)</p>

<p>During the day the rapid paced 5 min show and tells worked well in quickly letting everyone show a thing. Be present. Be the centre of attention. But they also too short and leave no room for chats.</p>

<p>I nicked time in each talk to ask a question. So when people were swapping over I&rsquo;d ask a question. But they left me wanting more. Much more.</p>

<p>When you get together so many smart people I feel you have to give space to comments. That freeform discussion space is where designers shine.</p>

<p>Lunch was amazing. Hat tip to Pete &ldquo;Two sheds but actually I only have one right now because I gave my son a shed&rdquo; Smith. We had to walk for it but I had a great plate of chicken kabab and chips.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great day. Loads of smart, fun people in the room. Really well put together by the London design gang!</p>

<h2>Stuff for admin users</h2>

<p>Something that popped up at the design away day. And reviewing some work recently, is the attitude towards professional/admin users by designers.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve heard elsewhere was lots of excuses how &ldquo;that&rdquo; group of users are different. Like they can&rsquo;t be overworked. Distracted. Confused. Need full love and attention.</p>

<p>Happily we have lots of designers who care. But plenty don&rsquo;t. Plenty throw away solid patterns because things aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;citizen facing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Like admin staff aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;citizens&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yes, if a user does a thing 20 times a day, certain patterns may need to be tweaked. Tweaked not destroyed.</p>

<p>Designers should be responding to user needs not preconceptions. And it makes me shudder when those preconceptions don&rsquo;t have a date with user testing.</p>

<p>Does your user do that thing 20 times a day?</p>

<p>I asked this question recently to a designer and the answer was 3 times a year. That isn&rsquo;t an interface that they know by heart. That isn&rsquo;t an interface they have muscle memory developed for.</p>
