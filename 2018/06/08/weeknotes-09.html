<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Started the week by finishing off. Wrote up and shared a prototype. Demonstrating what to show users who cannot save a choice.</p>

<p>Chased up human resources team on an issue for a junior designer.</p>

<p>Talked with the Thunderbird Product owner, Ruth. Position on a potential service. Interesting product. But in my mind, obsolete on go live. Solving a real problem, in the wrong place.</p>

<p>More “Making it hard work to do something simple” than “Do the hard work to make it simple”.</p>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Further work on leaflets and forms. How they sit within the content strategy for the site.</p>

<p>Little bit of chat about design roadmaps with a colleague. Made me think about method. Wrote up some notes.</p>

<p>Talk with product owner about the NHS number service.</p>

<p>Wrote down some stuff I had been filtering through my mind about consent. Tried to categorise some patterns of capturing consent. And some related components.</p>

    <figcaption>Passive and active patterns. And some examples of how those things are expressed and captured.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>Needless to say. Lots of clean up and work through. But better out of the mind than in.</p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>Verified cookie and analytics solution in live.</p>

<p>Worked with a programme business analyst to explain some dashboards. Talked through the numbers on the service.</p>

<p>Walked the same BA through a concept prototype. Explained the hypothesis behind it. Risks and costs attached.</p>

<p>Content strategy meeting with the programme and content designer. A good hour thrashing out the next three months. Concerns to test. Ideas to explore and things we need to have a clear answer to by October.</p>

<p>Got a massive thank you for my intervention with the last minute request before live. Feels nice to be thanked for being yourself and standing up for what you believe in.</p>

<p>Sketched up a &ldquo;hypotheses mapping&rdquo; process. Method to generate one. Improve it. Categorise it. And choose what to work on next.</p>

<figure class="noir">
  <img src="../../../images/consent/IMG_20180611_151355.jpg" alt="Notebook full of writing."/>
  <figcaption>Writing to teach helps you learn. It&rsquo;s how I always try to write. Always helps me find clarity.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Said farewell to a colleague going off on maternity leave. Added benefit of catching up with a colleague I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a while. What he&rsquo;s currently working on.</p>

<p>Caught an issue with one of the live error screens. Consequence of having to de-prioritise some work before go live.</p>

<p>Weekly design huddle.</p>

<p>Walked through the NHS referral service design. Future design concepts. Talked about product roadmaps. Getting good user centred design at the heart of them.</p>

<p>Cheeky pint with the designers from the huddle afterwards to end the day.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Triaged the error screen problem and offered two solutions. Immediate fix and an ideal long-term solution.</p>

<p>Quick meeting with the service owner.</p>

<p>Had a meeting with the new Thunderbird product owner. Caught up on the roadmap for two potential services she will be handling.</p>

<p>Spent a little time solving an NHS number-related keyboard on mobiles issue. Got a solution working across all devices. Some issues remain. Started writing up a blog post about it.</p>

<p>Packaged up a release for the NHSUK team. Surfaced a few issues. Planned next couple of releases with the programme team.</p>
