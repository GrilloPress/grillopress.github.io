<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Worked from home.</p>

<p>Finalised some personal development paperwork. For myself and a user researcher I career manage.</p>

<p>Updated the service prototype. Asked the team a couple of questions about what I saw as gaps in the content.</p>

<p>Quick chat with the programme manager. Future direction of the landing pages.</p>

<p>Got stuck into the new NHSUK redesign team&rsquo;s work. Exploring how our landing pages would fit right now. But also what we are planning on creating long term.</p>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Head&rsquo;s down type of day on the future of the service. Content architecture. Site structure and redesign.</p>

<p>Talked through the day to designers about their work. What was going on. What they&rsquo;ve seen and bouncing ideas between us all. Ideas are always stronger for sharing.</p>

<p>Little bit of admin for the weekly design huddle.</p>

<p>Updated the release prototype with a couple of extra changes.</p>

<p>Published my article about how <a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/06/26/things-are-different-in-live.html">Things are different in live</a>.</p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>Another day full of work on the future of the service&rsquo;s landing pages.</p>

<p>Helped a colleague collect some details for Expo.</p>

<p>Shared the new landing page direction with the wider team. Talked through the last round of user research and how to reflect what we learnt into our start page.</p>

<p>Caught up quite a bit with the NHSUK redesign team over slack.</p>

<p>Fired up the accessibility tools to verify a fix on the live solution. Getting better with the tools but the learning curve is immense.</p>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Met with Pedro, a designer on the NHS app team. Talked through the app. Design decisions on the National Data Opt-out. And how we integrate the service into the app to ensure users have control over their data.</p>

<p>Caught up with the Thunderbird team. Learnt that we were going to lose some talented people from the team. Not great news to say the least.</p>

<p>Hosted the design huddle. We had Dave Evans talk to us about &ldquo;publications&rdquo;. Was a great chat.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enjoyed today&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/NHSDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NHSDigital</a> design meetup talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/devansXD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@devansXD</a> (co-presenting here with the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/McVities?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@McVities</a> Jaffacakes) <a href="https://t.co/sROQENUZNF">pic.twitter.com/sROQENUZNF</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Duckworth (@AndrewDuck_) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_/status/1017479408783953921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A consistent issue across NHS Digital projects is a need to make navigating content work for people. Either in-page or across pages. It was great to hear from Dave what they had found designing for complex reports and publications.</p>

<p>Afterwards had a quick accessibility review with the Citizen ID team. How to make errors discoverable and clear for all people. Another great huddle.</p>

<p>Finished the day by writing up instructions for the NHSUK CMS team for an upcoming update on the train home.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Started the day catching up on an email thread about the performance of our two-factor process. With the help of Adam from the Thunderbird team, dug out some of our log data.</p>

<p>The development team had been asked a question two weeks ago about an issue. Though the numbers were fine there, I felt there was a subtle difference if we looked at an earlier stage of the journey.</p>

<p>I shared the data with the head of programme and the rest of the team.</p>

<p>The numbers helped focus the team from &ldquo;let&rsquo;s find out what we can improve about the two-factor journey for an unknown set of users&rdquo;. To &ldquo;we know users struggle on this page, right here&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After that met up with colleague (Dan) for a service review. And hypothesis generation session.</p>

<p>Dan was the junior designer on the service before and we ran a similar exercise when I joined the team (October 2017). Tables turned slightly as it was he who was asking me about the work.</p>

<p>We ran through the service questioning everything. Digging into compromises. Half solved issues. Alternatives and data. We asked the obvious questions. We did this screen by screen. Element by element.</p>

<p>As well as deconstructing things, we also created new ideas. Looking at alternatives. Considering other options we crafted up countless new ideas and things to try.</p>

<p>It was mentally draining and though. But great fun. We grabbed a pizza at lunch and took a pause.</p>

<p>Afterwards we&rsquo;ll rank and sort all the ideas and questions. Which will give us our backlog of design work for the service. We&rsquo;ll then share the backlog with other people in the team. Reorder, add things. Then get cracking.</p>

<p>Before the end of the day took a call from Tero, service designer on another team, to go through what we felt was our goals for a meeting on Monday.</p>
