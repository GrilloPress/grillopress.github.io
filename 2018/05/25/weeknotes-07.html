<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Started early.  Created two prototypes. Exploring different cookie consent banners.</p>

<p>One with a simplified yes/no choice. Another that gave users more control.</p>

<p>Shared the prototypes with the rest of the “Cookie cutters” for feedback. Rather than chuck some hypotheses and proto-personas at the group, I arranged a call.</p>

<p>Shared the “NHS number” prototype with that team as well. Got given the analytics code to add and talked through research options.</p>

<p>After my daily standup with Thunderbird I had the research planning call. Discussed the hypotheses behind the two versions of the cookie banner.</p>

<p>Hadn’t ever worked with the researchers before. You take for granted the chemistry you have with people. But the team was great and we quickly got on the same page.</p>

<p>Talked through the ideas. Shaped the research plan. Some questions were:</p>

<ul>
<li>What users thought the banner was about?</li>
<li>What (if anything) they thought the banner was asking them to do?</li>
<li>How they interacted with the banner</li>
<li>Did they know what cookies were?</li>
<li>How much did they know about GDPR?</li>
<li>Which prototype model did they prefer? Why?</li>
<li>What did they understand they were agreeing to?</li>
<li>What they understood by &ldquo;third-party&rdquo; and other terms?</li>
</ul>

<p>The plan was to get people with a range of digital skills through a pop-up in a library.</p>

<p>The researchers, Ana and Antonia, thought testing a third prototype would help them. So I got to crafting it while they shared the updated research plan in the Cookie cutter slack group.</p>

<p>Jumped onto verifying the service for go-live. Caught an issue with the footer.</p>

<p>Started an interaction flow in Sketch for the NHS number prototype.</p>

<p>Took a call with programme about cookies and analytics for the service.</p>

<p>Talked to a developer on the gov.uk slack about why they needed their NHS number. They’d asked in a channel where you could find it.</p>

<p>Late in the day heard back from the researchers with the pop-up results. We got six people through. Between the two concepts, users preferred having more immediate control.</p>

<p>Users understood what was being asked of them. And had heard about &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;. But they felt somewhat confused over the implications of things.</p>

<p>Part of this issue was that I had thrown the words together. And they weren’t great.</p>

<p>The other issue was that we were exploring the need for consent to advert placement/tracking.</p>

<p>In a scenario where you are asking people a simpler question, the binary yes/no option would excel. But, we had a scenario where we had finer grained layers. And as such, people liked that to be transparent.</p>

<p>The next iteration was then to fold in what we had learnt about simplifying the language. As well as drilling further into how to let people make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>More prototyping.</p>

<p>Dug into the cookies we were using. How to categorise them to something that’s easy to understand and doesn’t rely on web concepts or web terms. Tried to simplify things.</p>

<p>We shifted to terms we thought were more commonly understood. Things like “social media”. (Yes, still too vague&hellip;)</p>

<p>Explored addition concepts like “just in time” consent. This was more of a proof of concept. Not something we tested immediately.</p>

<p>Finished off the NHS number service interaction flow. Added more detail on errors and loops.</p>

<p>Got the final feedback on pop-up sessions for the latest prototypes. Progress on simplifying the concepts we are trying to get across to people.</p>

<p>Our design worked well. But we had an issue again with the language. Recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica stories changed how people perceived a few terms. Moving in the right direction.</p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>Improved the cookie banner based on the user feedback. Packaged up the prototype for implementation.</p>

<p>Later in the morning met up with a colleague from London to talk navigation. Love chatting to Graham but don’t get to talk face to face much. Nice change.</p>

<p>Met up with Ben. Took the opportunity to grab lunch. Talked through some stuff we were working on. Respecting context in interaction design amongst other things.</p>

<p>Talked to Adam from the Cookie cutter crew. Caught up with the implementation of the cooke banner. He&rsquo;d made great progress on two versions.</p>

<p>Said hello to an NHS graduate I met during the GDS course. Caught up how she was. What she is moving onto.</p>

<p>Caught up with Ruth the product owner for the new NHS number service. Talked through where the service could live if it is a goer.</p>

<p>Shared the wireflow kit I used to create the NHS number interaction flow.</p>

<p>Late in the day talked to a colleague from the NHSUK CMS team. About the prototype kit I made to explore their designs. Crafted up a starter kit for them.</p>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Though not announced until Friday, the Thunderbird team put the service live.</p>

<p>All things healthy and good to go. Nice moment. Particularly for a small team.</p>

<p>Took a bit of time to go deeper into the error validation and messaging for the NHS number prototype. With a small window until MVP it’s key to explore the end to end journey. Dead-ends and things we left too late on my current service.</p>

<p>Talked to a content designer colleague about help text and dropdowns.</p>

<p>Shared some stuff we found in user testing. She also suggested some stuff. Improvements for the service and new prototype.</p>

<p>Got sight of some of the launch day comms. It had changed quite a bit from last time. The plan was to announce the service in every national newspaper. As well as places like radio.</p>

<p>A couple of speakers for the weekly design meetup had had to drop out. Life got in the way. I presented on a recent issue. Had planned for the chat to end with a sketching session. But debate and discussion took us to a more strategic than interface level.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Launch day!</p>

</figure>

<p>Colleagues collected newspaper cuttings and shared where they had seen the service advertised.</p>

<p>Did a little more on error messages. This time some validation rules for the prototype and then wording on end-pages.</p>

<p>Helped the Thunderbird team on a range of issues and queries.</p>

<p>Chased up on some questions I had asked. Given some content for the service but bounced it back asking for clarification.</p>

<p>Went for lunch with the team and later in the day some drinks. Celebrated launching a service with a small, talented and motivated team.</p>
