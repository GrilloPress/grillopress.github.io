            <h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Slow day. Other things to sort beyond work.</p>

<p>Reviewed the new end of service feedback questions.</p>

<p>Wrote up some thoughts on a few issues.</p>

<p>Agreed to do a talk about GDS assessment to the graduate BA community.</p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>Most of the morning was a resetting exercise following the workshop the week before.</p>

<p>It can be tough to get talking about data with people. It&rsquo;s abstract.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re prototyping to explore.</p>

<p>Discovery so far has been slower than hoped. Some of that&rsquo;s due to changes based on feedback from a lab and workshop. Some of it other things.</p>

<p>Caught up with a graduate researcher to see how he was going on.</p>

<p>Spent the time before and after lunch mapping out an exploratory service.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to explore attitudes to data with a data donor service.</p>

<p>One of the provocative questions  underlining the prototype was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be happy if you or your loved one benefited from medical research, so would you be happy to donate your data to help this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re exploring:</p>

<ul>
<li>how happy people are to share data</li>
<li>what changes if they data is donated</li>
<li>what happens when people look at matching data with projects that would like it to be shared with. And those they wouldn&rsquo;t</li>
<li>what people need to know to understand research studies and make a decision about them</li>
<li>what we&rsquo;d need to show to give people a sense of positive feeling about donating</li>
<li>what people would want in a way or a happy ending</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Wrote a presentation about 5 lessons from doing GDS assessments. For the huddle.</p>

<p>Couple of issues here or there. Mostly spent time sketching a flow with Sam in response to the service we mapped out the day before.</p>

<p>Reviewed some work of Rhiannon&rsquo;s. Asked for her decision on what of the three options was her preferred thing to take forward.</p>

<p>Did some annual review meetings. Always important for people to know what they&rsquo;re responsible for. What good looks like and what&rsquo;s important to achieve.</p>

<p>Back on sketching out the basic flow.</p>

<p>Then to the huddle.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t end up giving my GDS presentation.</p>

<p>Talked about how we document designs and design decisions. Then an interesting issue from Ben Cullimore about highlighting that the NHS website medicines A to Z may not include every medicine.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Prototyping prototyping prototyping.</p>

<p>Divided up the work with Sam.</p>

<p>Talked to Ben about benefit realisation and OKRs (objectives and key results).</p>

<p>Joined in a discussion on slack about documenting design decisions.</p>

<p>Poked Mat Johnson to share his tweet in slack as well as the twitters.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Utterly <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lazyweb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#lazyweb</a> - <em>swiftly and simply</em> documenting and recording design decisions to create a usable record. What do you do? Any good posts I should look at?</p>&mdash; Mat Johnson (@demotive) <a href="https://twitter.com/demotive/status/1121335669958246400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>70 comments later I think it was a good thing to do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s key to split up what it is you&rsquo;re trying to document:</p>

<ul>
<li>How things act and look (now, should)</li>
<li>Changes to designs</li>
<li>Reasons for decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>These are overlapping things but to me do have differences.</p>

<p>A reason for a change doesn&rsquo;t need the whole service to be mapped out and every potential change shown.</p>

<p>But for a team meeting or planning session it might.</p>

<p>You have to find a consistent, efficient way to do this.</p>

<p>My design team, <a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html">we do hypothesis driven design</a>.</p>

<p>The goal being to log why we&rsquo;re making certain changes.</p>

<p>I used to put all hypotheses in the prototype. And some colleagues said it was useful. But watching them read it it was the major one or two before entry into a prototype.</p>

<p>It also got quite laborious to do it.</p>

<p>For the opt-out service I&rsquo;ve created hundreds of prototypes. Documenting all things on our Jira board and the prototype become tedious and inefficient.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re writing lots of text in a prototype, you&rsquo;re better off with a CMS or word document.</p>

<p>Within corporate environments there comes the question of shareability. If that document goes to confluence or SharePoint it might as well be buried in the garden.</p>

<p>But then, a prototype with a password and one designer to update it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a great sharing mechanism either.</p>

<p>So, you have to find your way.</p>

<p>But the way forward isn&rsquo;t doing nothing. Complicated systems need documenting. Teams need help being kept on the same page.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/01/08/kanban_for_interaction_design.html">Document your work as you go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html">Write hypotheses</a></li>
<li>Make it easy to understand your work</li>
<li>Make it easy to have a discussion about your work</li>
</ul>
