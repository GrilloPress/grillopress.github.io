<p>You should always get people outside your project or product to review your work. They&rsquo;ll ask things you haven&rsquo;t thought about. And question things you take for granted.</p>

<p>A question I got asked recently surprised me.</p>

<p>It was after talking through a change we made to the live service.</p>

<p>We had gone from a long list of exceptions to an easier to navigate set of headings and content.</p>

<p>We had tested the change. And had 40 users (from the age of 13) go through the work with changes here and there.</p>

<p>We had seen improved understanding. And created an easier reading experience.</p>

<p>The question asked was &ldquo;how do you know you&rsquo;ve tested with enough users?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The implication seemed to be that we hadn&rsquo;t tested with enough users to &ldquo;really know&rdquo; before going live.</p>

<p>But you never will.</p>

<p>You will never <em>know</em>  that a change is the right one. And you will never know how something will <em>really</em> work when live.</p>

<p>You can be confident in your hypothesis, your change.</p>

<p>You can do things to increase this confidence. And how likely you feel you&rsquo;ll get something right.</p>

<p>Like testing in realistic context and with a range of users with different abilities and understanding.</p>

<p>When reviewing changes this is actually a great question to ask yourselves:</p>

<div class="question">How likely is it this change will solve [the problem]?</div>

<p>You can also frame your research around the change to make clear what things would increase your confidence:</p>

<div class="question">We&rsquo;ll be more confident in this change when we see users understand that their data can still be shared in certain situations</div>

<p>When you change your service. You&rsquo;ll never know. So, you keep listening, keep learning and change when you need to.</p>

<p>That is agile. That is design.</p>

<p>As a designer your job is to navigate that uncertainty. But you never know, you know.</p>
