<p>Back in August we had a challenge. We had a method of authentication that worked pretty well, but needed an NHS number.</p>

<p>If you have your NHS number we could be pretty sure to find you.</p>

<p>But NHS numbers aren&rsquo;t something that everyone has to hand.</p>

<p>They should be on letters, prescriptions and the like.</p>

<p>But not everyone has had a recent appointment. Or keeps their letters. And some letters don&rsquo;t include the NHS number (even though they should!). Never mind the NHS number being easy to find on a letter.</p>

<p>Though not a thing some users can&rsquo;t get. Many users told us that they contacted their GP receptionist and after a few questions for given it. The NHS number represented a significant speed bump.</p>

<p>Something that stopped users being successful first time. And in the worst cases, a potential barrier.</p>

<p>Our challenge was to make accessing the service not rely on the NHS number.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to throw away our path that worked for many.</p>

<p>The API we used however offered an alternative. We could get a patient by NHS number, but also by their personal details.</p>

<p>The details were:</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>date of birth</li>
<li>postcode</li>
</ul>

<p>And</p>

<ul>
<li>gender</li>
</ul>

<p>Name and date of birth confronted no significant issues. We knew some users would struggle a little with postcode.</p>

<p>But the biggest worry was gender.</p>

<p>The reason the API asked for that was because it was a clinical API.</p>

<p>It was a requirement for the API. No &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; allowed. We&rsquo;d need to ask for it.</p>

<p>We were also told to try we couldn&rsquo;t get around this.</p>

<p>Though we knew many users wouldn&rsquo;t blink at this question. Our service lets users choose if their data is used for research. We don&rsquo;t want to embarrass or impede anyone making that choice.</p>

<p>Our service is for everyone.</p>

<h2>New hope</h2>

<p>In a meeting with colleagues from another service I noticed they used the same API. But weren&rsquo;t asking for gender.</p>

<p>I pressed hard on how they got around it.</p>

<p>Email confirmation after the meeting we had an answer.</p>

<p>We could call it several times for each gender or category stored.</p>

<p>The other service would have much higher traffic than ours. We had precedence and I had enough ammunition to get my way.</p>

<p>We would do the hard work to call the API four times when a user gave us a postcode instead of an NHS number.</p>

<p>Several prototypes later, 800 a/b tested users later and we had confidence in our design.</p>

<p>Service redesigned. Service load tested. New way of using the service released.</p>

<p>Over one third of our users don&rsquo;t bother with an irrelevant question.</p>

<p>Our service does the hard work to make it inclusive.</p>
