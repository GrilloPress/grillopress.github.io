            <h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Met with Phil Cooke from the Data request service and data access environment.</p>

<p>Talked about background to some of the internal data pipeline for NHS digital. Constraints. Things to improve.</p>

<p>Saw the benefits of a cross programme workshop we held before. Getting out of your part of the business is the type of thing that rewards you long after the initial reason you held a workshop.</p>

<p>Had a couple of practical questions answered. And a name to help with digging into the API/database which logs where your data has been shared for research and why.</p>

<p>Reviewed the opt out service development backlog. We have four tickets left (!)</p>

<p>Reviewed the prototype from Friday. Few things to glue together. On reflection a few things to clean up.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s always some rework moving from a sketch on a sticky note to another level of fidelity. And that&rsquo;s fine. Things sound better in the head and worse when said. Giving things shape will always be a challenge.</p>

<p>Sam asked for <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/29">examples of declarations from around government and got linked to this</a>. A reminder that GitHub isn&rsquo;t always obvious to search, but is a treasure trove of information.</p>

<p>Reviewed some information architecture issues with Rhiannon.</p>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Wrote up some notes into a presentation. Tussled with it for most of the day. Didn&rsquo;t quite get the narrative right.</p>

<p>Retro and planning with Will, Lucy and Emma.</p>

<p>We talked about what we&rsquo;ve got in the next few weeks. I talked a little about getting to the heart of what makes a research study an attractive for someone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d gotten my hands on an API spec so will jump into what we log about research studies at NHS digital.</p>

<p>More work on a presentation. Still didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>Chat with Jordan (grad researcher). Catch up on how he&rsquo;s getting on.</p>

<p>We talked about being able to talk about why you use a method and tools. Job interviews and assessment criteria.</p>

<p>More tweaks on a presentation. Still didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>Popped onto a call with the leadership team of the NHS website.</p>

<p>Gave the presentation. Went fine. Gave a service eye&rsquo;s view of a few issues with the website. Nothing insurmountable. Everyone was very nice.</p>

<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<p>Talked through the job descriptions with Sam. What type of things a designer needs to show. Matching it against the spec etc.</p>

<p>Dialled in to the content huddle. Really glad to see the content community chatting through some issues. Was about the <a href="#">care cards component</a> and some questions about implementation.</p>

<p>The strict scenario the component should only be used in means it&rsquo;s something you should set apart from the rest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a general building block.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more of a very specific solution in response to a very specific scenario.</p>

<p>A solution that:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re unsure works in the specific situation it handles</li>
<li>Unsure whether every type of &ldquo;get help&rdquo; should be solved by the care card</li>
<li>Unclear how it&rsquo;ll work alongside other cards or long pages of content</li>
</ul>

<p>The type of thing that should be shared and discussed as a solution to a particular problem. But rolled out cautiously.</p>

<p>Pop up day in Bradford uni for the research team. 98% of those talked to would be happy to proactively share data with the NHS.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting things shared (Will being heckled one foot into Bradford).</p>

<p>One person who didn&rsquo;t want to share their data but it was nothing to do with the NHS. They just didn&rsquo;t trust data being shared on computers. Once it&rsquo;s online or in a database it could be leaked, hacked and shared beyond purpose.</p>

<p>We also heard about someone who is happy to share but where they used to live they would have said no. With concerns about the weaponisation of data.</p>

<p>People told us &ldquo;for training&rdquo; was a good reason to share data too. Hadn&rsquo;t heard that before.</p>

<p>Reviewed the pages on the NHS digital website we want a survey. And what we wanted to ask.</p>

<p>Sam did some great work on search terms in Google analytics and Google search console.</p>

<p>Sam made a list of pages that would be good to ask questions on. We went through reviewing each page if we had specific thing to find out.</p>

<p>Shared the questions round the team.</p>

<p>We based our questions on something that really worked for us on the health records pages before. With a tweak or two.</p>

<p>Emma had a couple of questions</p>

<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>Talked through some changes to the data donor screens with Sam</p>

<p>Then had a debrief with Ruth and Sam about the pop-up the day before which lasted most of the morning.</p>

<p>Lunch then reviewing our work. More prototyping.</p>

<p>Mainly in shared docs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re using a shared doc to write the screens in shorthand.</p>

<pre>
( ) For radio buttons

[ ] For checkboxes

[           ] Input fields

[ Buttons ]

Etc.
</pre>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t new. I&rsquo;ve been writing notes to myself in a mixture of shorthand and markdown on my mobile.</p>

<p>But we agreed it works for us working together. In that space between sketch and full screen or prototype.</p>

<p>Went over earlier to BWP so Sam could get the NHS app environments set up on her laptop.</p>

<p>Good huddle reviewing some work on eRS.</p>

<p>Nothing will make your work better faster than sharing your work in the open.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll hurt at times. But do it early and often.</p>

<p>And if someone asks for your help listen to the constraints. Context. And give them the fruit of all the hard work you&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p>Seeing and critiquing other people&rsquo;s work will make you better. You&rsquo;ll see things that&rsquo;ll work for you. And spot issues you have too.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>I always try and make Friday a chatty day. Answer emails. Respond to questions. Post questions. Raise issues or fixes on GitHub.</p>

<p>Today was no exception. Wrote up some documentation too.</p>

<p>Answered some development issues and dug into why some CSS was working on the prototype but not a build environment.</p>

<p>Wrote a few sketches up.</p>

<p>Reviewed Sam&rsquo;s work on the prototype. Helped her stitch a few things together and taught her about JavaScript objects.</p>

<p>Rhiannon noticed a couple of things so fixed them in the opt out prototype. Chatted about a question from Ruth. She&rsquo;s going to dig into the data and see what&rsquo;s what.</p>
