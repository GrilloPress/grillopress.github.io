<p>Very busy week. Wake up at 4 in the morning thinking about work type of busy.</p>

<p>Some good news (eventually) on Monday. Now a <em>senior</em> designer.</p>

<p>A friend asked what that means. Doing the same things I think. And helping out on a new project.</p>

<p>We did a lot of user research as a team this week. Two pop-ups and two workshops. With a lab and a patient panel planned the week after.</p>

<p>Busy.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s hard work making this simple</h2>

<p>Lots of time spent discussing, exploring and trying to make the log of where NHS digital shares data simple.</p>

<p>Found it hard to make it simple to grasp what data has been shared, to who and why. Without adding unimportant noise.</p>

<p>In isolation the things aren&rsquo;t difficult. But the ordering and interconnected bits are.</p>

<p>In one data sharing agreement you may have your data shared as part of 40 different datasets. All to help a local area evaluate and plan services.</p>

<p>The size, shape and structure of every data sharing agreement is unique.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t want people to have to know how the system works to see how the system is working for them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d also help if the content wasn&rsquo;t so academic.</p>

<h2>Your job is to help the organisation make better decisions</h2>

<p>About a year ago a team from GDS came to the digital delivery centre and I walked round with them for a little bit.</p>

<p>We talked a little about adopting more agile ways of working within programmes.</p>

<p>One of the guests asked a good question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you helping the programme make better decisions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a question I didn&rsquo;t have an answer to. But it was one of those that stuck with me.</p>

<p>The depth to which you can answer this question is a sign of your impact as a designer or researcher.</p>

<p>Working in agile ways means you make decisions more often. You respond to change. You test things. You make change possible and at a lower cost.</p>

<p>As a designer you ask questions and force decisions. But you need to be purposeful about your work and ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>What decision is my work helping to make?</li>
<li>How do I help make that decision?</li>
<li>How do I help make the best decision for the user and the organisation?</li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;re likely to get pushback when you start working like this. More so if you&rsquo;re working beyond how something &ldquo;looks&rdquo; or how the interface works. People will challenge why a designer is caring about certain decisions or business process. But your job is to challenge thought processes and deliver value. If you&rsquo;re not challenging you&rsquo;re probably not designing for a better outcome.</p>

<p>On Friday we had a show and tell that I felt forced a decision and delivered the evidence to make a better choice.</p>

<p>By the end we&rsquo;d agreed what evidence was left to capture and what we needed to do to finalise a decision.</p>

<p>But also how to communicate that finding beyond our organisation so the whole system stops repeating the same research and finding the same thing.</p>
