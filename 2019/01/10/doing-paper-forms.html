            <p>I wrote up some notes for someone to recap the advice I would give myself if I was doing the paper forms for the service again. Here they are.</p>

<h2>Things to do or think about</h2>

<h3>Review current or similar services</h3>

<p>Review the current service’s offline route. Or, if none, find the most similar service with current offline processes.</p>

<p>Think things with similar needs to:</p>

<ul>
<li>prove address</li>
<li>prove name</li>
<li>financial history (bursaries?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Talk to the service owners about issues. System side and user side. Talk to the contact centre and what themes they get (back that up with data as well).</p>

<p>Remember that you’re not just prototyping the form. But the process. So, letters, emails and call scripts. Before, during and after submission.</p>

<p>Get permission to go through filled-in forms. Review in a team submissions and note things that work well and don’t work.</p>

<p>Use:</p>

<ul>
<li>sticky notes</li>
<li>pens</li>
</ul>

<p>And write down notes, collect and analyse like you would a user lab.</p>

<p>Collecting observations and notes. Make sure to make extra notes where people have crossed things out and filled in their own answers as well as mistakes and misunderstandings.</p>

<p>People in this session:</p>

<ul>
<li>researchers</li>
<li>designers</li>
<li>service owner</li>
<li>product owner</li>
</ul>

<p>And anyone else you can get in the room. It is a rewarding but slow process. Be sure to draft in lots of assistance and help.</p>

<p>Feedback findings to contact centre team and those involved currently for things to implement or solve quickly.</p>

<h3>Review your questions</h3>

<p>Start from the beginning. You have your user needs and outcome they want to achieve. Ask what you need to get from them to help them achieve their goal.</p>

<p><a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/12/05/questions-for-your-questions.html">Conduct a thorough question review</a></p>

<p>Keep these questions and answers in a spreadsheet. Yep. A spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Be sure to use their language not yours.</p>

<p>Remember that offline services can’t give instant validation. Clear instructions are key. But also remember that users can’t be redirected to the correct parts of a service as clearly either.</p>

<h3>Make prototypes early and often</h3>

<p>Typically you should aim to prototype:</p>

<ul>
<li>paper form/s (you may need more than one)</li>
<li>page paper form will live on (standalone or on the service)</li>
<li>guidance document if needed (people don’t read these so keep it light)</li>
<li>call script</li>
<li>introduction letters or emails</li>
<li>letters or emails informing the user of an error</li>
<li>letters or emails confirming receipt of submission</li>
<li>letters or emails confirming success</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike a digital service, it is extremely easy to rapidly prototype paper forms and make them live.</p>

<p>Unless you are great at things like Adobe InDesign, rapidly prototype with Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>Share liberally.</p>

<p>Placement will go funny often but the key is being able to create lots of versions quickly that you can put in front of people.</p>

<p>We got to version 21 before we were happy enough to publish one.</p>

<p>Remember that you’re not just prototyping the form. But the process. So, letters, emails and call scripts. Before, during and after submission need designing too.</p>

<h3>Get testing your process</h3>

<p>Paper is cheap. Get testing questions and assumptions often. Test by:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing quick crits inside your organisation</li>
<li>getting call handlers and contact centre staff to fill it in</li>
<li>doing pop-ups with similar users (Keep pop-up lightweight)</li>
<li>in labs where you can explore the whole journey end to end</li>
<li>in context. Home, office or similar</li>
<li>getting call handlers in the lab with you and simulating any phone conversations or emails</li>
<li>sending out early prototypes through the post to people on research panels (after they have agreed to do that, obviously!)</li>
</ul>

<p>And be sure to test with people:</p>

<ul>
<li>with access needs</li>
<li>on the go or working away from a home address</li>
<li>with non-nuclear family structures</li>
<li>with two addresses, no address or a difficult one (canal boat)</li>
</ul>

<p>Get reviews from the wider organisation and experts and helpful friends around the design community.</p>

<p>As well as how well the form will help the user get what they want, ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>how will they find the offline service</li>
<li>what conditions they would use it</li>
<li>how they will find the documents they need</li>
<li>where they would send the form</li>
<li>what standard of post</li>
<li>when and how they expect to hear back</li>
<li>how they would print the form or related documents off (if needed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key design principles</h2>

<h3>Design for context</h3>

<p>Remember your user is not able to know they’re filling in things right. Keep instructions clear.</p>

<p>Don’t try to ask two things in one question.</p>

<p>Keep addresses, emails and phone numbers clear. Expect pages to go lost or not to be read correctly.</p>

<p>Know that users won’t have clear cut relationships and situations.</p>

<p>People divorce. Never get married in the first place. Move address. Keep old addresses in certain systems. Work far away from their “home” address. Live on a boat.</p>

<p>People also don’t print stuff out that often either. Find out how people will do that.</p>

<h3>Consistent not uniform</h3>

<p>Your offline service should try to match your online service in name and solving the same need.</p>

<p>Don’t have a different name for the service, but do:</p>

<ul>
<li>change questions if they make more sense offline</li>
<li>provide additional information you may not on a screen</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t need to match any online service completely. Deviate where it makes sense.</p>
