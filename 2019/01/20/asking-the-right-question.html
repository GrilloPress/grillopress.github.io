<p>The key to getting to a good solution is in asking the right questions.</p>

<p>Recently my son came into the kitchen where I was cooking. He wanted to ask me how to do something in his Minecraft mod.</p>

<p>He wanted to know how create a DNA extractor.</p>

<p>I was in the middle of making some naan breads so couldn&rsquo;t google it for him that second. When I tried to find the answer I couldn&rsquo;t find the extractor. It didn&rsquo;t seem to exist.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t odd in Minecraft. Most mods aren&rsquo;t well documented.</p>

<p>Frustrated I told him I couldn&rsquo;t find it. I asked him why he wanted the extractor. What it&rsquo;d let him do. Turned out one of his dinosaurs had died. He wanted to create it again and only had the meat left over from the last one.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t want a DNA extractor. He wanted his dinosaur back. And he had some raw materials to use but no way of getting a new dinosaur.</p>

<p>I googled about the dinosaur meat. I found the answer in about 30 seconds. He can use the meat to get the DNA he wanted with tools he already had.</p>

<p>He was happy. So was I.</p>

<p>It also made me realise how I should have been asking why he wanted the thing in the first place. What outcome he wanted and why.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not always about being resourceful. It&rsquo;s often about asking the right questions. </p>
