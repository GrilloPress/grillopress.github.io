    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet another busy week. Something of a pattern for April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the week finishing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error messages. Form downloads for the offline service. Helping the Thunderbird team update the transactional service with some small tweaks. Bit of career management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped get a grad I met at the GDS training in touch with Thunderbird&amp;rsquo;s talented delivery manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent lunch with a friend from a different team. Ended up in a random Italian place. Talked about the tension of delivery and delivering the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with the service owner. Thrashed out how we are going to help all the teams on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folded in the new HTML email design into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got told I had to use a real life photo on a slack instance. So, used the first one in my phone. Got trolled hard. Obviously just too saucy. Too Mills and Boon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="half"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
    &lt;img width="100%" src="/images/mills_and_boon.png" alt="A joke mock-up of a Mills and Boon romance novel called 'Kanban at midnight' feating Andrew Duckworth's face"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Available in all good bookstores&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost count of the amount of people who told me the photo made me look fatter. Thanks. I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent some time with the user researchers. Ever since we had to move offices, the team hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to sit together. Although Slack helps. For some people you need to get together face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked through the private beta findings. We used &lt;a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html"&gt;&amp;ldquo;System Usability Scale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; as well as a comprehension survey. Great usability scores. SUS scores place the service in the top 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehension is a worry. There was a recent phrase change that we can point to as causing a drop in comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoyed going through the screen recordings. Will build the findings into a show and tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with communications teams from various parts of the organisation. Working out how to help coordinate any old content and how that gets updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked to a GDS designer about their prototyping kit. Some of the reasoning behind certain design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototyping kit is a tool that brings patterns into life. As such, less is often more. If you have too many patterns, or too low a bar for a pattern you increase the potential for teams to put in place things that are going to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too few, or too high a bar for a pattern, then people will do what they need to do to get the job done right now. Often at the expense of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got asked to produce something for the minister. Asked for clarity on a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a meeting with the service owner and content designer. Went through the transactional service. Talked errors, issues to implementation, emails and planning for planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met up with a new designer, Alexandra. Working on the buying catalogue. A market place tool for procurement for CCGs. Interesting stuff. Hard challenges. Loads of potential. Was great to meet her. Had many questions about styles, patterns and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also talked about measuring usability and comprehension and how to get that in place for alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large planning meeting with programme, Head of Product and Thunderbird tribe. Pretty productive. No fuss. Bit worried about the level of work I am touching on in the next few weeks. Need to sketch a plan of action. Will pair up with another designer again to get some of the design work into the product for the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside planning had to pull in some changes for a prototype for
the minister. Took a fair chunk of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got invited to talk at Agile Manchester. Taking &lt;a href="http://uxinthecity.net/2018/manchester/sessions/index.php?session=311"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Making UX Agile&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owned a lot of flexitime. Took some. Alongside a little bit of work on the prototype and the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent some time exploring the GDS prototype kit and the inner workings. With the aim to pull in some features into my personal kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learnt lots from all the prototypes I&amp;rsquo;ve built since early October last year for NHS Digital. Important not to get hung up on all the hacks. Also important to learn from them and make life easier next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another busy week. Worked through some issues in implementing the service&amp;rsquo;s site on the NHSUK platform. Spent some time learning how GDS and gov.uk do design in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the week talking design principles. We have some draft NHS design principles up on the wall in the Digital Delivery Centre. Right now we have nine principles. To kickstart conversation I asked what two principles people would remove. We had a pretty healthy debate.  It was interesting to see slight differences between interaction and service designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the principles may actually be better described as behaviours.  “What makes someone a good designer” rather than “what makes something a good design”. Something to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into Stephen Corbett who was in his last week. Talked about service design with him and the world of “UX”. Going to miss Stephen. Always good fun and a smart mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a sprint retrospective with the Thunderbird tribe. Then walked through some storyboards for a side project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended the Digital Delivery Centre experience design team meet up. Talked about the progress of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked from home. Crafted a sitemap for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcomed new member of the design community via Slack. Always make a point to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelled down to London later in the day. Had a 40 min delay due to a passenger medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got to my hotel fine. Right next to the tower of London and tower bridge. Missed out on being able to catch my brother before he left work and a friend. Worked out meeting my friend on Thursday though. Next time I have to stay over in London I will arrange something with a friend or a colleague beforehand. Felt bored. Had a wonder and took some photos to relieve the boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/london/tower_bridge.jpg" alt="Tower Bridge in black and white with heavy shadows"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a wonder up to Whitechapel after strolling around St Katharine’s. Beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First day of the GDS course. Talking principles, user stories, service design and journey mapping. Before getting into interaction flows with Tim Paul. Some of the day seemed out of sync. We did journey mapping before research. Seemed in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a great lunch from a local street market. £5 for a massive chicken tikka roll, meat samosa and a drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/london/team_with_tikka.jpg" alt="Four designers eating Chicken tikka wraps in a street market"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption class="noir"&gt;Street food on a Yorkshire budget&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoyed spending the day with a group of people doing digital stuff for government. Paired with a graduate from NHS Digital, Sam as well. Enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a night out with the team from NHS Digital. Had a blast. Pizza. Beers and good company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day at the training started with content design. Sam shone here. It’s always great to see people doing what they love. We also heard from Ed “from slack” Horsford about the journey to create the passport service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing an interaction design review with Tim Paul. Piped up a little too much. Particularly here. But interaction design is my jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on after work met a friend. Had some beers by the river. Funny how far we’d come from when we first met in a small publishing company in Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last day in London. Started it early by touring around the City of London and enjoying the sights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="half"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/london/noir_gerk.jpg" alt="The Gherkin building in London in black and white with heavy shadows"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Gherkin. Always swamped and surrounded by other buildings but standing out by its shape.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/london/lloyds.jpg" alt="The Lloyd's building in London in black and white with heavy shadows"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Lloyd&amp;rsquo;s building. Brutally showing its bowels.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training was about using the gov.uk prototyping kit. A couple of the NHS Digital grads didn&amp;rsquo;t get IT to put the kit on their machines. Tried to use a browser based option. But all the platforms had issues. Either with gulp.js (glitch) or with a need for a credit card (Cloud9, Koding) or some bizarre no access to a terminal on free accounts (codio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paired with one of the graduates and let her use my machine. It was great to see the GDS designers and frontenders there to help. Being able to cobble together an interactive prototype is a fun and powerful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room benefitted from there being plenty of examples in the kit as well. Lots of lessons for NHS Digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to catch up and jump into many conversations through the day about my normal work. Found it a touch stressful as the project is gearing up to go live and not being in Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to give weeknotes a try. A round-up of my work week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planned out some content changes for our prototype with the content designer. Folded some changes into it. Took a good chunk of the day. Enabled the programme to review content and site structure in preparation for going public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrote a little more on personas for an interaction design course I am creating. Editing it led me to reading &lt;a href="https://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/05/the_origin_of_personas"&gt;Alan Cooper&amp;rsquo;s The origin of personas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mucked about with a screen recording tools or two in preparation to record the course. In-built Mac tools turned out to be the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Played a &amp;ldquo;silence game&amp;rdquo; imagined up by our delivery manager Sophie to review the product backlog. Worked pretty well. We all agreed she needed to write it up and patent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/silence_game/having_fun.jpg" alt="Thunderbird team having fun playing the silence game"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption id="silence-game"&gt;The Thunderbird tribe having fun. Quietly.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lent a helping hand later to take a couple of people from GDS on a tour around the Digital Delivery Centre. Talked a little about the way we had evolved our design process on my project to keep it agile and outcome focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They raised some interesting points.  You need to make sure you don’t just provide the business with the ability to make decisions. But also help them make the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took some time to design how offline forms are going to work on the service. Explored current solutions used by the NHS Choices website and DVLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewed the designs with several other designers. Found out that a colleague getting married soon (Congratulations Karl! Pizza in the post please).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t underestimate the value and importance of sharing work early and often. Got some great ideas and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very intense day started in a usability lab. A lab with a focus on how contact centre staff would do assisted digital journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was impressed with the problem solving from the call centre staff. Guiding users and developing and remixing the call centre scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made me think about organisations like Automattic that ensure their developers spend a week a year doing phone support. The idea being to keep them  aware of the problems their users face. Feels like a concept that would help designers building software for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/canalside.jpg" alt="A canal in Leeds"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption id="canalside"&gt;I walked a lot. Between three offices. Luckily the walk is pretty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with a graduate I have been mentoring. Talked to his assignment manager too, a product manager on the project he was on. Seemed like a really nice team. Got invited to their next show and tell by the product manager. Will make a special effort to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked a question in the design slack and on Twitter about the use of personas. interesting debate and discussion. Will write it up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted the design huddle. Heard from the delightful Dean about the “redesign” work. They’re working on foundational elements for the rest of the organisation. Raised the issue of forms and transactional service design. Talked a little about my forms as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a few more changes and questions from the programme but got all the content approved and ready for public beta!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chased up the status on the service&amp;rsquo;s offline forms and handed over design and content to the NHSUK migration team, in readiness for the site going live in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bumped into some of the redesign team. Was nice to chat. Got invited to talk forms and redesign. Will need to find a day or half-day to come over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a coffee and chat about design at NHS Digital with one of my favourite people, the magnificent Tero!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a good catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t get to talk double diamond enough. Need to make sure we don’t leave it to goodbyes to talk our favourite subject.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of months I have been designing for “comprehension”. Helping users understand a very complicated and emotive subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not “done”, recent success in user labs has given us some scope to focus on other risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that people start our service understanding the thing they are doing. And what they need to have to complete that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been looking at how we inform users of the process they’ll about to undertake. How best we can let them know if they are able to complete the journey online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to read a few things about start pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class='weekly-link-list'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“It means people can use services much quicker, and they have detailed information in the place they most need it”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First was
&lt;a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2013/12/20/start-pages-within-guides/" target="_blank"&gt;"start pages within guides". &lt;/a&gt;
A blog post from 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it the team behind the carer’s allowance explained how they integrated their start page into the guide itself. Reducing the steps required to get the allowance and making it clearer that users could make a claim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are dealing with quite a complicated subject, you don’t want to dilute the message with the practicalities of how to start an online transactional journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it makes sense to have the journey start from where users are. Where they can jump back and forward and get the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='link-to'&gt;
Read more:
&lt;a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2013/12/20/start-pages-within-guides/" target="_blank"&gt;Start pages within guides&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“You’ll only be able to ask users clear questions when the process itself is clear”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I kept googling I re-read the
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/check-before-you-start" target="_blank"&gt;“Check before you start”&lt;/a&gt;
pattern. This is where you take users through a set of questions that pre-checks whether they are able to use the service in question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “before you start” pattern was something we toyed with in an earlier prototype but the journey felt like we were begging the question. The outcomes were too simple and as such didn’t add much value to the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I see this filter pattern or similar really shining, is when you have several closely aligned transactions or services. Services with a single entry point that users might not immediately see significant difference between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, the filter works like visiting a GP. You know what symptoms you have and the expert (the service) through well thought-out questions kickstarts your journey into the appropriate part of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='link-to'&gt;
Read more:
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/check-before-you-start" target="_blank"&gt;Check before you start&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“We have been able to dramatically reduce the amount of content on the start page”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another thing I looked at was the
&lt;a href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns/interruption-card" target="_blank"&gt;“interruption card”&lt;/a&gt;
pattern on the Home Office digital pattern library.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern matched something we had been trying to design before users got presented with a form to fill in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often you want to create a frictionless journey for your users. But when you need them to understand something, you need to introduce friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interruption card does this well. It looks different and therefore surprises the user somewhat. But isn’t so different that they think they have gone to another website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It summarizes the journey and requirements well, combining with the start page to increase user comprehension over two pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern benefits from being within the journey of the service. Once a user has started a journey or transaction, they appear to take the information more seriously. Or at least, a lot more seriously than they do on the start page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice in the pattern page calls for caution. Not to use the interruption card pattern too often. What is interesting about this is that the instances of the card I have seen use it quite extensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than an interruption card, it becomes a journey within a journey. A phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='link-to'&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last week was a pretty intense one at work. It included a full day in a usability lab and a day working on design principles for the NHS on Thursday. I also helped handle some more junior designer recruitment stuff as well as plan the next iteration of the prototype I am working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond work, life was not so great. Though the week ended on a high note finding out that we will be welcoming a daughter to the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary and link to some of the things that I have been reading and thinking about in the last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class='weekly-link-list'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Put field labels above forms and wait before a user submits a form to provide error feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not a new one, but I shared
&lt;a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahci/2011/202701/" target="_blank"&gt;Working towards Usable Forms on the World Wide Web: Optimizing Date Entry Input Fields &lt;/a&gt;
to a collegue over Slack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It explains that you should put field labels above forms. This lets users complete forms faster and with less stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also explains that users make more errors if you validate your fields inline as your user inputs their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a portfolio-pretty approach, but let a user submit a form. Then provide them with feedback on whether it is correct. This approach points towards keeping forms short. And taking users through your service one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='link-to'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The NHS belongs to the people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england" target="_blank"&gt;NHS Constitution &lt;/a&gt;
is a ridiculously inspiring document.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the guiding principles of the NHS. The aims and goals of the NHS and what it stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was officailly published in 2013 but built on things like the founding principles of the NHS, the Patient's Charter and similar documents. It has since also been updated, with 2015 being the latest revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line is "The NHS belongs to the people".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked for the NHS for a while and whilst I knew parts of it and seen it quoted around and on posters, it wasn't until the last year that I really sat down to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work for the NHS or have any sort  of love for it, I recommend reading part if not all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The NHS Constitution was on the forefront of my mind this week as I was at a meeting to help draft up some design principles for the NHS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At a previous meeting an NHS Digital colleague Nicola, mentioned the NHS Constitution as a guiding light for any principles. I thought Nicola's point was spot on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we worked on reviewing some design principles I brought them up again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay focused on the user. It doesn’t matter how much experience you gain as a UX Designer, our main job is to solve user needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since before Christmas I have been helping our with junior designer recruitment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to make sure I was giving constructive career feedback to candidates. This led me to read Cinthya Mohr's
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/google-design/tips-for-starting-or-growing-your-career-as-a-ux-designer-ad8dbf1eb2d6" target="_blank"&gt;Tips for starting or growing your career as a UX designer. &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key process I use before doing anything is to reach out to people who I know who have done things before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to google things to see what other people learnt and what advice they'd give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area I thought  juniors could do with some pointers is how they explain their design process. In particular the process behind a key portfolio piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinthya's piece did a good job of laying out how to build a narrative for portfolio pieces.  It resonated with what I wanted to see from the designers I interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently at work I have been using a Kanban board with a colleague to manage our design work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although early days, we have found it to be a real help and it has garnered some interest beyond the project we are on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the board with the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track what each other is working on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record our design reviews and comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better develop our design process (using hypotheses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record design decisions and evidence for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show our process to the rest of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to (visually) organise and  priortise design work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involve our Product Owner in priortising what design work was being focused on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are the sole designer/UX person, it is valuable to be able to communicate with other people on a project what you are working on and your current priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board has helped us structure our work and track it better, as well as expose that workflow to other members of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also shown us where our design bottlenecks are, and what things we need to swarm on together to speed up and get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes discipline to maintain but provides real value if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id='so_what_is_kanban'&gt;So, what is Kanban?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you've worked on a software project before, you may have encountered
&lt;a href='https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban'&gt;Kanban boards.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Kanban board, items (jobs, tasks or anything) are written on cards which sit on a board in a set of columns. Each column has a label indicating the cards status or activity. The cards move across the board as they change status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest Kanban boards are structured in three columns of "todo", "doing", "done". Often this board structure then evolves with a "backlog" or "ideas" column preceeding the todo column for ideas to be stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='todo-board'&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Ideas
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Todo
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Doing
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Done
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many workflows ours didn't feel like it fit with this simplisitic structure. But we did feel like this technique could help us structure our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id='how_we_implemented_kanban'&gt;How we implemented Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step we took was to sketch out the phases a bit of design work would go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test if it would work we realised we needed to get this on a whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found some whiteboard space (a precious commodity) and started to draw our board up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We both knew this was going to be a long journey. There was also a risk of exposing our work too early and receiving too much input too soon. It's better to get something up and public. The risk was worth the reward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First implementation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going backwards and forwards over the column names, we sketched out our board and added some cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='A Kanban board drawn on a whiteboard' src='/images/boards/first_iteration.jpg'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the columns were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id='first-implementation'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backlog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is where our ideas live. Design hypotheses. Components to look into and explore. Things to optimise. Bugs or "That's not great is its".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Elaborate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase where we are actively working on a problem, but exploring the shape and size of it. Looking at current solutions and the reasons they exist, as well as other people's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Refine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are refining our ideas into testable chunks of work. Sketching paper prototypes. Thinking how a problem might be solved but an iterative area of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Build&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stage where we formally think an idea is worth pursuing. We have a hypothesis, we have refined it and now want to build something formally to test and review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal review time. Either with a fellow designer or a member of the product team (or programme or beyond).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Test/Evaluate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get it in front of people and work out if it has the desired outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Done&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All work finished. Idea explored, built, reviewed, tested with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got something up. And the second we did we saw what we felt was right, but also what we felt was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't know where and by whom something was reviewed. Nor did we get a good sense of what was bouncing around after review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to ensure our process was repeatable. Repeating high value things like documenting design decisions. We wanted to have that explicit, rather than implicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As designers we're part of the board and ceremonies for the development team. Our work feeds into the Scrum/Kanban flow of the development board, but we help with frontend tickets too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear immediately that the development board of the project we were on had informed us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had copied some of the naming conventions and flow. It felt like it captured some of what we wanted to do, but not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exposing the workflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had started using the board. As we used it and explained it, it felt like there needed to be an iterative pattern or process in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, this is where we got a little too complicated early on. We knew we would see real value in exposing the iterative nature of our work. We struggled to find that balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having looked for other examples of designers using Kanban, I stumbled across
&lt;a href='/'&gt;this blog post about Kanban&lt;/a&gt;.
It explained how Conceptboard had used it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the Z-shaped pattern quite interesting.  It showed the iterative pattern of a design artefact going through rounds of review and refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this, we created a less-conventional Kanban design that looked like the below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='z-board'&gt;
&lt;div class='backlog'&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Backlog
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='research'&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Research
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='design'&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Design
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Prototype
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Refine
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='review'&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Review
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Design
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Project
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
External
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='done'&gt;
&lt;h3 class='h4 title'&gt;
Done
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Documented
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Shared
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='inner-row'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Deployed
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this structure is that important sub-phases of design are exposed. The flow of a card on this board is still left to right but if a card merited it, it could fall through additional phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A card that goes through review would jump from
&lt;strong&gt;Design - Prototype&lt;/strong&gt;
to
&lt;strong&gt;Review - Design&lt;/strong&gt;
moving after that again into the
&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;
column but this time in the
&lt;strong&gt;Refine&lt;/strong&gt;
cell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cards would now move through a Z-shape or in a circular fashion. Their iterative journey surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second feature was the drawing out of what wanted to make sure we did with each bit of design work. The process of documenting and sharing our work and then getting it in a product (prototype or production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this now it is easy for us to see the faults.  At the time we were so close to it, it took us time to step back and see what was working and what wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We sacrificed the simplicity of our board to expose the iterative flow. We had completely messed up any notion of done by filling things in that column rather.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wider feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now felt ready to ask for some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed an experienced service designer I knew and walked him through the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great to hear he loved what we were doing. He also poked and prodded the thinking behind everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Taking the time to explain your concept is often the quickest way to expose the holes in your thinking. This is because you have to explain your idea without your hidden assumptions and background knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The complicated nature of the flow was clear.  Not in the fact that the designer couldn't understand and appreciate the flow, but that he was completely unsure of how it would work by looking at it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting point the service designer made was about our prioritisation of cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I mentioned that we wanted to have a sense of what was more important. Our idea was to rank cards and show that on the board with high priority cards being at the top of the
&lt;strong&gt;Backlog&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As I was talking through the board the head of the user research profession walked by. She asked a couple of questions too. A real reminder of the amazing place that I get to work where I can casually talk to two amazing, talented and experienced individuals about a sub-project I am passionate about.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Designing the card&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we had been iterating our board we had been taking real design tasks through them. The design of our cards hadn't received much love or attention at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first our cards consisted of their title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we added a short description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started to toy with the idea of colour indicating the type of design work. This was something that the developer board of our project did well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed our Product Owner to walk them through the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They appreciated the clarity into our process and what we were working on. The ability to influence and ensure things he saw down the line would be accommodated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that it would be valuable for them to be able to see where design issues or tasks came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This felt like that a great idea. On each card we added a "referral" tag. This one-line tag, indicated where the problem or task came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='kanban-card'&gt;
&lt;div class='title'&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Title of the Kanban card
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='stickers'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='desc'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Description of the hypothesis, thing to explore or issue raised
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='referrer'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Originator of idea/issue (Project, Lab etc.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now had a stronger structure for our cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, it felt like an optimisation too far to use coloured cards. We knew there was value to that system of categorisation. But it felt like a premature optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had plenty of space left on the card to add things like tags, avatars and Jira numbers. And plenty of time to have finer grained categories too, further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simplifying it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board now felt like it was adding value. The cards were now easier to understand and the board was explicit at which stage our work was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development team we sit in has a very experienced Scrum Master. I felt the board and my ability to explain it was now at a point where I could expose it further and to more rigorous examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grabbed some time and took them through the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board received more love. But the Scrum Master also noted two things they would change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The board column structure was too hard to understand at first glance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn't really have a real done column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been easy to argue with the Scrum Master and say that an iterative process cannot be displayed in a linear fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this was the third or fourth time we had heard something similar about the visual structure. Every time we explained it, people understood it. But we wanted this board to expose something about how we worked to our project and the wider organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking the Scrum Master about other ways of displaying iterations he mentioned the use of sticky dots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea seemed like a very neat way of indicating what had been reviewed and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this opportunity we went back to basics. We explained our work flow and design process to the Scrum Master who scribbled on the board as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/images/boards/analysing_the_flow.jpg'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another iteration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Another iteration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the session with the Scrum Master meant we had an alternative way of displaying our iterative process as well as some tweaks to our columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drew up our board and made a few tweaks again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src='/images/boards/another_iteration.jpg'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new column structure was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id='another-iteration'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Backlog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is where our ideas live. Design hypotheses. Components to look into and explore. Things to optimise. Bugs or "That's not great is its".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the product team, we routinely rank and evaluate items here. Ensuring everything has been designed and tested before being put into the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate something is more important, it sits higher up the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase where we are actively working on a problem, but exploring the shape and size of it. Looking at current solutions and the reasons they exist, as well as other people's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are exploring and then refining our ideas into testable chunks of work. From sketching paper prototypes to screens or HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an item has a sticky note, it has been reviewed and an indicator of an item going through some further refinement or exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal review time. With another designer. The idea here being that we stage a time for each and every piece of design work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments and suggestions are made and then saved. A sticky dot with the reviewer's initials are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the item is deemed to need some further work, it can go back to the design column. If it is ready for wider review or would benefit from it, it moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wider Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review with the wider team/s. This ranges from informal to formal reviews with the product team to more formal processes including the wider programme, other organisations and entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this stage, as with the design review column, a sticky dot is added. The name or initials of the reviewers are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card then can return to design or move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Document&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staging area where we either create or collect our design artefacts together in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also add a design hypothesis (or two) to each ticket to surface our assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;User test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get it in front of people and work out if it has the desired outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Done&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All work finished. Idea explored, built, reviewed, tested with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottlenecks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found two bottlenecks very quickly with this process. Design review and document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottlenecks were faults of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking time to formally review, rather than quick glances, slowed things down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to review design work and not question enough with a colleague. To give a quick glance and a supportive remark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as make the time to thoroughly review things, it was clear that we needed to pass through things to review quicker as well. There is always the temptation to hold onto things until they are perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes reviewing harder. It also takes a lot longer and can stall other work you or colleagues have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board highlighted that we needed to review early and often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documenting things well can be a tough task. The board revealed to us we weren't documenting as we went enough and this added another bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is of course "be better at documenting" but also make it easier to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using a
&lt;a href="/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html" target="_blank"&gt;hypotheses driven design method&lt;/a&gt;
we adopted a lean way of articulating our design decisions and what we were aiming to test with each change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also used the comments section of a corresponding Jira card to document our review as well as attach any screenshots, PDFs, sketch files or links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we made it easier to document our design decisions, we got better at documenting as we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of using Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey using the Kanban board has only just begun but we've seen some real value already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it we're able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track what each other is working on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily record our design reviews and comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involve our team in our process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuously inspect our process and decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make better stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has played a core part of integrating our design process into the wider product and team. It has improved us as designers. It has organised and evolved our process. It has made it easier to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're considering using one, do it!&lt;/p&gt;
