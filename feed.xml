    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little while back I was talking to a colleague about dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key value of a dashboard is insight and clarity. Not data. Not numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your service’s KPIs are indicators, not the story. And not an insight in itself. You need to give people a clear direction of what’s happening, why and what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked in publishing the data team created a tool to help visualise publishing topics. The idea being to give editors insight into lucrative areas to publish in. How topics related. And the potential market size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool was great engineering. But added no value. The issue  was that the only people who could get value out of it, knew the topics and relationships already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a nice tool. But one that only provided insight to those who could already see the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often the problem with dashboards. Understandable for the creators. Not for the stakeholders. Consumers and decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating dashboards ask yourself what do we (and/or our users) need to know? What insights are important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great place to start is with problem statements. If you don’t have them, they’re worth generating retrospectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have we seen and what are we trying to solve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will we know when we&amp;rsquo;ve solved that problem or created that outcome?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to inject numbers into a dashboard. Particularly as a team that understands them or can interpret them. Things like time on site, bounce rates, response times, scroll depth are all interesting things. But what do they say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If those terms are new or unknown, they say nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to tell the story of whether users a doing a thing, make that immediately clear. Clear without need to interpret numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a hierarchy. An important thing to explain. Follow the fundamental design principle of making that hierarchy clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dashboard that asks you to interpret data doesn’t offer insight. It may provide you with enough to get there in raw ingredients. But will everyone with 60 seconds understand and see the story? If you provide the raw elements to understand the live service, it&amp;rsquo;s like offering someone a burger. And then giving them wheat and raw mince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your dashboard counting how many eggs you have, or making an omelette?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Advice for aspiring junior UX designers</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I helped recruit a junior designer. I got to talk to many talented junior designers on the phone and face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the process I made a note of some general advice I felt could help many of the candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following tips are my advice for aspiring user experience designers. Though many of the points could apply to any role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CV advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your CV keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of general advice about CVs that also holds for designers. Keep it short as possible. To the point and easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting as a designer to spend too much time on the visual design flourishes of your CV. But for user experience roles, the key thing to get across is that you understand your user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your user cares about being able to scan information about you. Keep it neat. Keep it clean and minimal and easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your CV works on different devices and the links actually go where you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the job role and related info and check you have what they need. On each criteria write one-line of how you’ve shown you have that skill. With the ones that you are less confident on, how can you show how you are developing that skill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list helps form your CV, cover letter and interview answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the role is for a junior post, companies will be expecting some weaker areas. They need you to be able to show understanding, passion as much as actual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion and willingness to learn isn’t something an employer can teach. HTML is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have lots of gaps (things you can’t even show you are trying to address as a weakness), don’t apply. Don’t waste your time on something you are not a good fit on. You’re not going to get past the CV sift where it is as much matching keywords as it is your potential. If it is a dream job, you now have a list of things to get good at and prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t apply for a role you&amp;rsquo;re a nearly match for. Those you should. Job roles are perfect fits. No one is perfect. But don&amp;rsquo;t waste your time and emotional energy on something  you&amp;rsquo;re not a good fit on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cover letter advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your cover letter match the language the company uses. If the job post talks about interaction design, call it that. If they call it user interface design, likewise. Like mirroring someone’s body language, mirror their conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Portfolio advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your portfolio make sure you have a strong narrative. You should write them using a schema like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary. A short description of what you did. Tweet length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context. Provide the background. Where it was. What it was for etc. in one or two paragraphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process. Describe the broad strokes of your design process. This should be the meatiest part. Ensure you describe how you put the user at the heart of your process!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcomes. What did you produce and what outcome did it create for your user?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lessons. What did you learn and what would you do next time? A key skill to a good designer is learning from mistakes and applying those learnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to underestimate the importance of being able to explain your design process. You must be able to explain what you did, how you did it and why you did it. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say it&amp;rsquo;s easy. But you&amp;rsquo;ll stand out as a candidate if you can take someone through your process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interview advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with your portfolio, it is vital you are able to explain your design process. The steps you go through to design something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many face to face interviews you’ll have to take someone through a portfolio item. Or tackle a design challenge. Being able to explain your process will make you stand out. More so than eye-catching visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A caveat to this advice to not to be rigid in your process. Be flexible. Understand that there are techniques appropriate in some situations. For some problems, you need to be very lean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A textbook large-scale discovery isn&amp;rsquo;t the only tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse good client management with user testing. Unless your client is the only person to use a system, it is likely they aren’t the user you are looking for. A/B testing with a client does not replace user testing. Client driven design is not user centred design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal as a designer is creating a product that works for your client’s users. Do this and your client will see the rewards from happy users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Post-interview advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how well it went, try to ask for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t get the job, ask why. Remember that it is often being able to demonstrate your skills as having them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewer cannot assume you have skills. They need you to state them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;General advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be yourself. Be your best self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got this! Good luck. If you want any further help, feel free to message me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Treat your design process like a design problem</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before going on leave I got to work with a graduate designer (Sam) who will be joining me on a couple of projects. Over three days we covered interaction flows, content architecture and paper forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Sam joining me, it made me think about design process. Creating a good one. A repeatable, efficient process that creates great outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst working on the National Data Opt-out we (myself and a junior designer Dan) crafted a process that helped us explore a massive range of ideas and issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process didn’t appear fully-formed. It took many iterations. It evolved through experience and being worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/01/08/kanban_for_interaction_design.html"&gt;I blogged about the journey&lt;/a&gt;, centring on our use of a kanban board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to creating a great design process is to treat it like a design problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by stating the issue you want to solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sketch out crude flows and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a prototype and use it in anger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate over things again and again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek feedback from those around you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate and defend your ideas to expose flaws and strengths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kanban board felt the best mechanism to control and test the process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With new work and a new team, it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to explore our process again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Trying to keep these even leaner. Going to focus on a few themes from a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Paper forms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal crusade with paper forms right now. We have three for patients. And soon have some for prisoners (filled in by prison medical staff on behalf of a prisoner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re not good enough. People can muddle through them. But they&amp;rsquo;re not the standard we need to be hitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the back of a great session at the design huddle with Caroline Jarrett I had a strong action plan. I even tweeted it for feedback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Any other solid ways of researching paper forms?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re doing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;+ looking at real paper form submissions&lt;br&gt;+ working with team who get forms and action them&lt;br&gt;+ user lab focused on paper forms&lt;br&gt;+ Challenging the need for stuff in the forms 😁&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrew Duckworth (@AndrewDuck_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_/status/1039789320792666112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And got even greater feedback and connections to people willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme agreed to do everything to make them better. With a bit of campaigning we&amp;rsquo;ve got access to the current filled in forms and will review them next Wednesday as a team. We&amp;rsquo;ve also booked in a lab and potentially some pop-up testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created a clean form system. Brutally simple graphic design system. Now to make our process brutally simple for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Design meet up!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week it was the quarterly all-hands design meet. In London this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy going to London. That said, though the venue was great, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as iconic or scenic a walk this time. And it was also a rather painfully long day. Thanks trains!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I got to express my inner artiste:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The best name badge I ever did have. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AndrewDuck_&lt;/a&gt; 🦄 &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH2DBkcFRu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH2DBkcFRu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Louise Mushet (@louisemushet) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/louisemushet/status/1039883809553084416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hang with lots of cool people. (Special shout out to Louise Mushet who made the day extra fun without a few of my design besties!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day the rapid paced 5 min show and tells worked well in quickly letting everyone show a thing. Be present. Be the centre of attention. But they also too short and leave no room for chats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nicked time in each talk to ask a question. So when people were swapping over I&amp;rsquo;d ask a question. But they left me wanting more. Much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get together so many smart people I feel you have to give space to comments. That freeform discussion space is where designers shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was amazing. Hat tip to Pete &amp;ldquo;Two sheds but actually I only have one right now because I gave my son a shed&amp;rdquo; Smith. We had to walk for it but I had a great plate of chicken kabab and chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great day. Loads of smart, fun people in the room. Really well put together by the London design gang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stuff for admin users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that popped up at the design away day. And reviewing some work recently, is the attitude towards professional/admin users by designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;rsquo;ve heard elsewhere was lots of excuses how &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rdquo; group of users are different. Like they can&amp;rsquo;t be overworked. Distracted. Confused. Need full love and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily we have lots of designers who care. But plenty don&amp;rsquo;t. Plenty throw away solid patterns because things aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;citizen facing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like admin staff aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;citizens&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, if a user does a thing 20 times a day, certain patterns may need to be tweaked. Tweaked not destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers should be responding to user needs not preconceptions. And it makes me shudder when those preconceptions don&amp;rsquo;t have a date with user testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does your user do that thing 20 times a day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked this question recently to a designer and the answer was 3 times a year. That isn&amp;rsquo;t an interface that they know by heart. That isn&amp;rsquo;t an interface they have muscle memory developed for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day with the regular UX meeting. Talked about the lab for the next day. Timing wise and what we need to cover is pretty tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototype ready to go. Added some behaviour to simulate live timings and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically don’t simulate things like spinners and delay in a prototype. The idea being that a prototype is testing a hypothesis. Not your ability to make it seem like live. But what we’re testing is behaviour influenced by time. Delay. And the impact of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re exploring adding an extra way to find your credentials. Right now, we have a high percentage chance of finding users’ contact details. But, we are asking that they use their NHS number. We’re exploring alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives that may not suit everyone. And introduce new potential failures. But also make the service easier to use first time for many more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent a lot of the day chatting with a colleague Ben. Lots of fun but also sharing research and ideas. Images, designer collaboration. Ensuring styles stay consistent. Helping new and emerging services learn from what has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that vein, reached out to a colleague. Offered some help on a few things that I felt weren’t quite right. Planned to work together and get stuff going in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All day in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine people through three prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring how we could open up the way people authenticate using the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had people from NHS England, Department of Health and NHS Digital observe together. As well as some very senior stakeholders. Which was great to see. A result of hard work campaigning and pushing a user-centred agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting moments in the lab but not as much clarity as hoped for the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One moment was when a user said they preferred a version they struggled with. One of the programme manager&amp;rsquo;s asked &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;. It was a great teaching moment that what people ask for, isn&amp;rsquo;t always what works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day after the lab. Planned some initial steps forward with the service’s authentication design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensive talk with the researchers to plan some A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off project work. Working on a more aligned style for a colleague. Simpler screens. One thing at a time. Not one field. But one ask for the user. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if your users are skilled administrators.  You treat them with the same care and attention you would on any other project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely busy day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with a colleague Dan who used to be on my project. Was great to catch up and talk through his work and catch up him up on some of the things I’d been up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked over to my new office. Tagged along with a researcher Lucy who I enjoy chatting with. She’ll be on a project that I will lead design on. Looking forward to working with her and another researcher Will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New office is nice. Have a whole floor to ourselves and lots of whitespace. And a football goal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked into a crisis. Something in the “do later” column was now “get it done yesterday”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went over to another office to attend a meeting I had set up. Originally to sketch out the interaction flow, but now more of a crisis meeting. Productive meeting. Got to eek out the problems we need to tackle. A shared response as well as way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back over to the new office and walked into a technical deep-dive. Some possible ways forward immediately became problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was intense. But enjoyable as well. A team pulling together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Played a little football together and then broke for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch across Leeds once again to meet the researchers and talk through our A/B testing scenarios. We mapped out our ideas. Where we needed to split users. Type of activity you can tie yourself up in knots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back again across Leeds to the new office. Again walking into a few more discussions. A few more constraints uncovered. A direction forward starting to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent most of the day working on a framework to help do all the A/B testing. Just simple JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added it to my prototype and cut two versions to test. Created a landing page for the experiment as well as a end page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared the prototype with the researchers. Now to chuck 250 people at it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished off the short-term roadmap for NHSUK development work. Shared it and asked for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met up with the Thunderbird product owner. Heard about a better direction for a large piece of work coming out of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended a Programme patient facing services meeting. Part of a regular Monday meetup. We talked about the various work streams. NHS app integration. Analytics on the service. User journeys on our NHSUK landing pages. Measuring how successful our authentication work has been. And the numbers I dug out about the two-factor element of our service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good meeting. Tough things to discuss. But cracking on. Making things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting caught up with our content designer. We talked about my “hub” page concept and his content audit and how to best take those two things forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with the developers and then walked to the Citizen, NHS app and National data opt-out cross-service meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitched what I saw as the model of interaction we should be striving for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had prepared for this meeting by talking lots. Understanding constraints on all sides (design, technical, delivery).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Three NHS services in a room. Talking through making things easier. Better. Exploring possibilities and making plans to test things. What I joined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NHSDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NHSDigital&lt;/a&gt; to do&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrew Duckworth (@AndrewDuck_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDuck_/status/1018889390473478147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day collecting all the improvements we’d made since going into public beta.  For a report to the Department of Health and Social Care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large chunk being accessibility improvements. Still lots more to make. But rewarding how much we’ve made the service better already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed a “scheduled maintenance” page for the service. As the service matures, we’re refining the messages people see when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chased up some work we’re relying on another team to complete. Bit of career management. Training courses. For myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started a presentation about the reasons why we should move to a new content architecture. As much an exercise to get myself prepared as anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed an interaction flow for the service. Exploration of the app/service integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re distributed around offices, we have two weekly calls for design and research. We talked at length what we saw as the biggest problems facing the service. Came out with an update to our service polls. Had a great session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we had an authentication review. A vital meeting to dig into our biggest problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a range of potential solutions. In the meeting we thrashed through the pros and cons of each approach. Outcome of the meeting was a sprint based on testing a two-track authentication approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting one of the user researchers said to me “You were really on it!”. Made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked the programme if there was any possibility we could get a graduate designer to join the team. Got a pretty quick yes. Wrote up the form. Sold the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the rest of the day sketching flows and screens for the next prototype iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the morning catching up with some of the user centred design team from the Digital Delivery Centre. Then talked service design with Tero and Simon. Integration between Citizen ID and National data opt-out. Both short-term and long-term visions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked the person in charge of the graduate programme if the form was any good. He submitted immediately and said it was great… Finger’s crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewed the new NHSUK grid system. Found a place we’d need an override. Opened an issue for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit of admin with the weekly design huddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started a new prototype series to explore the alternative authentication approaches. Was nice to be doing something with my kit again. Although I was ripping lots of things out, I have it all well set up. Integrated some of the NHS number finder code into the kit to get me ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easy as a designer to want to switch tools. To move to the next thing. Though there is much I want to improve in my kit. It works and I’m productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended sprint planning with the Thunderbird team. Talked the delivery team through the design hypotheses behind the future authentication work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also talked through some of the work we’d need to do around the two-factor code screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is often a bit of tension when new work is iterative rather than incremental. A move from 1.0 to 2.0. But understanding the why. The outcomes that are desired makes the jump easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great session as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day with a content architecture review. Ian the content designer had crafted up the content and pages he thought vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked through the hub pages together. Noted a couple of changes. He sent them over ready for a new hub page prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the rest of the day working on the new authentication prototype series.&lt;/p&gt;
