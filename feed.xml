    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working in a team it’s important to find a way of having presence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to think presence is about being around a lot. Always connected or online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not. It’s you and your team having a sense of each other. And what you’re up to. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence can be being online together. But presence can also be silent. And just a feeling of connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong presence can be a hard won thing but it’s built through simple things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear communication when you’re heads down, not around or what you’re tackling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s doing the work to make your efforts open and collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’s most simple it’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making clear what you’re tackling that day or week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telling people when you’re around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being clear on what you can handle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for help or a second opinion. And willing to offer a second opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking up when things aren’t clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to say why you’ve done what you’ve done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be especially daunting to make yourself heard and your boundaries obvious as a junior colleague. My advice is always start with when you’re around or not. And the rest can follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not have to be available all day and at every hour. Nor do you need to have your camera on and always be on a call to have presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence is just a sense that people know you’re around and what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A good question isn’t going to magic away a terrible policy or an unintuitive process</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can only do so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your roof is leaking, improving your form&amp;rsquo;s questions is like changing carpets. Yes you’ll need new carpets, but it’s best to fix the hole in the roof first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often what teams are asked to do. That or provide waterproof carpets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A service I worked on a couple of years ago suffered from this problem. The team made the service easier to use. Faster to get through. And findable. But it didn’t fix the more structural issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in a similar position be clear about the limits of what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also don’t lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a good question or clear content can do is highlight how odd a policy or unintuitive a process is. And that can help you make an argument to rethink a policy or process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good question isn’t going to magic away a terrible policy or an unintuitive process. But it helps shine a light on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Do less</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The single most powerful thing to getting great performance from a team is doing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restricting scope. Adding a constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I talked a team through some of my discovery work. They&amp;rsquo;re picking up the work for alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strongest bit of advice from what they had started with was to do less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery made several recommendations. And I could see the team was chomping at the bit to get lots done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in trying to get to the bigger goals they&amp;rsquo;d tried to tackle three or four problems at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the size of the health and social care sector, even a small problem has immense scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allowing patients to do simple things like check and update their contact details online we solve multiple needs. Improve the quality of data. And give services better quality data. And confidence in that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also extract value from processing people are already having to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is a small service. But doable. And something that can impact 60 million records. And give patients more control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing less they&amp;rsquo;ve got more chance of having a big impact. Of navigating policy and law. Of getting something live and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes things much clearer. And it also lets you get deeper into things. And you spot opportunities and issues earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reducing scope you can also finish work. The teams I see struggling are the ones who get 80% of their work done but can&amp;rsquo;t finish off before the next chunk of work comes along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do less. Get things live. And learn. Then you can evaluate what value there is in doing more or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A retrospective on your retros</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a software development team you may have done retros. Regular events where teams reflect on what&amp;rsquo;s gone well or not recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their goal is to play part in creating an accountable team. One that talks honestly to each other. That checks what&amp;rsquo;s happening matches the outcomes they want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular team meetings where you can talk to each other about what&amp;rsquo;s working. What isn&amp;rsquo;t are a good part of holding yourself and others accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doing retros only gets you and your team so far. They need to help you hold each other to account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test how useful retros (and similar things) are by asking a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel heard or talked at?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is everything someone else&amp;rsquo;s fault or failing? [The developers, the designers, policy etc.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are solutions thrown around before the problem is completely voiced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team come out with any actions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do those actions actually happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does anything change afterwards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the same topics or issues keep coming up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do people&amp;rsquo;s real complaints or issues get aired in the retro, or in private conversations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer to these questions makes you feel like retros aren&amp;rsquo;t working. Time to change how your team holds each other accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to be honest and clear about how working like you do right now isn&amp;rsquo;t working.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Still waiting for perfect</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You have a great idea. A research technique or plan. Or an idea for a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just a few more things in place you&amp;rsquo;d be able to do it. With just more discussion you&amp;rsquo;d be able to get it just right. And then you can do that thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be waiting for perfect forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will it not happen but it starts blocking other similar things from delivering value. From getting stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more toxic than perfect. It blocks getting small stuff done. It means nothing similar can be completed. And nothing else learned. Because &amp;ldquo;why are we doing this first, when we could do this [perfect] thing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because perfect is always waiting for that last thing to finish it off, it&amp;rsquo;s always out of date. So when things do align you&amp;rsquo;re getting back to almost done. And never done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re struggling with waiting for perfect ask yourselves and colleagues what&amp;rsquo;s stopping you from doing it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if there&amp;rsquo;s a way to do it even imperfectly in the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it done in an imperfect way and learn something. Once you test something you&amp;rsquo;ll find perfect wasn&amp;rsquo;t real anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn something. Stop waiting for perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making outcomes clear</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A core component of a good team, and accountability, is being set up for success. For yourself. And those around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being set up for success is about having a clear sense of the outcomes you want. And the capability to deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can measure this with some questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I clear what I am looking to achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are others around me clear what I am trying to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I have the skills to achieve what I need to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I do not have the skills, do I have a plan to develop them? Or access to resources that mean this doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I know when I am done? When I achieved what I want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would other people agree with that measurement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good answers to these questions will involve good communication between you and others. And knowing how things get &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; (If that is vague where you work. It&amp;rsquo;s worth mapping it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also have to be honest about your limits. Something I have always struggled with (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be the person who can do it all?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being clear on the why and how something&amp;rsquo;s going to get done is how you create accountability. And with a clear way we can measure success, everyone is able to help judge and support each other to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it clear what outcomes you&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve. And how you&amp;rsquo;re going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
