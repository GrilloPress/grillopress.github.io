Provoking prototype&lt;br&gt;
Prototypes that provoke&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit ago I came across a thread on &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/beliebig.eu/post/3lw2l77owhc2z"&gt;BlueSky&lt;/a&gt; (that twitter replacement thing) about them. But it wasn’t the first thing in the last few weeks where I’d seen or heard it. Ralph Hawkins mentioned them in their &lt;a href="https://ralphhawkins.co.uk/posts/weeknotes/2025-08-09-doing-the-hard-work-to-pretend-its-simple/"&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; and returning to a year old one for a new round of provoking and stirring up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t come across the name, you might still have used one or seen one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A provotype is … a prototype used to provoke a reaction or upset in order to stimulate reflective thinking or new ideas based on that provocation. This sort of prototype is not about usability. It’s not about can someone achieve a task. It’s about provoking a reaction or changing things or turning things upside down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right fig-right-gutter" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/2880px-Archizoom_per_poltronova,_sofa_superonda,_vinile_su_gommapiuma,_1967.jpg" alt="A wavy red plastic chair that critiques the shape of a sofa"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Italian Radical Design from the 1960s aimed to disrupt how we saw objects, space to push the boundaries of what our lives and living would look like. Creating many provotypes like this red sofa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If many prototypes start with a “what if” a provotype is just a version that dials up the difference and strangeness to 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The provocation can be about the materials, the way you think about a concept, how 2 things work together (or don’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototypes that provoke are common in the fashion industry. Designers will create runway one-offs that are exaggerated, impractical and try to upset normal ideas about things. They build hype. But also try to challenge norms and create or surface new aesthetics. Those ideas get translated into altered patterns. Toned-down silhouettes. And eventually into high street fashions. Going from provotyping to mainstream. From extreme forms and upsetting commonly held ideas or approaches into refined products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people doing product, interaction or service design a provotype might just be a vision where AI, data or users do a thing that feels impossible or unlikely. It might switch something from the user needing to prove to an organisation assuming something. It could be bringing in collaboration or other viewpoints in a crucial moment that feels unthinkable right now. Whatever it is, from smaller interface details to services and platforms. It creates a radical &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before you run off and put on your most garish outfit to try one. I also think it’s important to understand whether you want or need to provoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upsetting or upending or rethinking is not always going to get the results you want. You could probably think of a fair few people you’ve worked with who struggled to work with ambiguity or not being in control. There are some people who provoke and others you bring along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some you can’t provoke yet but need to win some trust before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people who are welcome to upending everything. And those that do not. I’ve dealt with this situation recently. Having 1 team who love it. And another who cannot stomach anything like that. My current strategy is to get the team who cannot stomach it to create the provocation with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also found that it’s a useful technique to be less ambitious with a conservative team but use that as a provocation for THEM to say what would be more ambitions (ie. show a thing that’s today but a few jumps ahead, but use it to ask them … what would be more radical than this?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other reasons or situations you wouldn’t want to provoke too hard. Life is tough. Doing research on certain topics, it’s just not a sensible idea. You don’t want to trigger upsetting and dangerous reactions. It’s best to leave those subjects with a more trauma and person-considered approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you show your stakeholder your next prototype with aims to provoke (rather than placate) you’re following in the footsteps of fashion designers. Maybe exaggerating access or ease of data collection. Maybe showing the inner workings to an extreme level of honesty. Or changing how something looks and feels in a way people would never think they could but wished would work like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything needs to provoke of course. It’s just another tool in the toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was watching a documentary a while back about gut health. In it a woman was making home-made “fecal transplants” (Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind FMTs are that you can kick start or change your gut’s system by acquiring the outputs of another. It’s as odd as it sounds. There’s some evidence that it can help in some cases, particularly some stubborn infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right fig-right-gutter" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/Notes-on-notes.jpeg" alt="A pile of notes sitting on notes, dripping and expanding - artwork by Andrew Duckworth"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Cultural change isn’t just a one off injection. It takes serious “diet” change.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the clinically approved stuff, the woman in the documentary had a blender with some poop in it. She had used her boyfriends and her brothers poop to restart her gut. Made pills out of them. Switching between the two as she noticed different side effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the influences on our gut health is what we eat and consume. It has a massive impact on our life. Too much junk food then our body optimises for it. And the cultures and things needed to digest more healthy food disappear. But it’s not just food. One of the side effects of antibiotics is that they will indiscriminately kill lots of things. Good or bad. And an encounter with them can really give your gut problems. Diet or drugs, starting a cycle where we can’t even digest or consume the nutrients we’re missing anymore. And then we need significant reboots. Leading to the the need for FMT in some extreme cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watched this documentary - my wife’s idea I feel I should add - I first thought I was glad I didn’t know this person and had eaten at their house. Watch whose smoothies you enjoy and any second-hand blenders you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I thought about it again. This time when joking around with some colleagues on a particularly tough transformation project. Like a fair few consultancy projects, there’s a fair degree of an organisation wanting a transplant of culture. Not the gut kind (thankfully!) but how things are done, made and rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire being “show us how you do stuff. Join in, be a centre of good culture and we’ll take that and scale it across the organisation”. This all sounds great. 
But the problem is that most places who want this are too large and too hostile for new culture to be transplanted. And will not pay to keep transplanting the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural change isn’t just a one off injection. It takes serious “diet” change. It’s not something you can borrow, blend up, and hope takes root. It needs a proper change in “diet”. And that doesn’t come from a workshop or a new comms strategy. It comes from what leaders do. And from the people doing the work — who, let’s be honest, have seen this before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have also heard “this time it’s different” a hundred times. They’ve sat through the launch events, the away days, the bold new strategies. And then they’ve watched it quietly fade away when things got hard or budgets got tight. Or had to pretend reorg 2.0 is better. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s what came before but with a new name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want this stuff to stick, you may have to go slow to go fast. Backing it properly by starting small but with funding. Giving teams space and protection. And without pressure to scale before you’ve got something worth spreading. This doesn’t mean without accountability or being open. It just means not trying to scale across the entire organisation without understanding what it is you’re scaling. And not falling into the trap that you’ll change how things work without work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means repeated investment. That means money. And senior leaders changing too. Not just doing what they&amp;rsquo;ve always done. Not expecting everyone else to change but them. It also takes a lots of people agreeing a destination and process and sticking to it even when it gets uncomfortable. Because the destination is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is where most places struggle. Like a crash diet, they want results by the end of the week. They want faster delivery, clearer outcomes, everyone working smoothly. But the brutal truth is when you’re resetting an organisation’s guts, it often gets messier before it gets better. Things slow down. People get uncomfortable. Your goal will involve some new directions and techniques. And that’s exactly when you have to hold your nerve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change doesn’t come from the transplant. It comes from everything you do after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many times when you’re building things for people that are clearly very outside your own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently worked on a product for probation officers and people on probation. Something I had 0 experience of beforehand (Though as with anything, I love to get into the details and have a greater appreciation and understanding of it). But there are also times when the things we work on we a deep have an understanding of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying things. I buy things. Driving. I drive. Things related to health. I have a mixed level understanding of the parts of health as a user (and having worked in and around health for 10 years lots of other understanding beyond being a user too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are more common or commodity things. Things like getting online, shopping, health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right fig-right-gutter" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/person.jpeg" alt="An artwork of a person made out of pink sticky notes"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;This isn’t just a tech thing of course. Some of the greatest experts are often the poorest judges of the other needs and experiences of people&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those there’s a chance, a good chance you’re a user too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal first and second-hand experience and knowledge can be a powerful factor in helping creating better products and services. It’s why understanding context works. Why people who really know a thing can be so successful in creating new products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t mean you’re your user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work in tech or IT you’re probably already a different sort of user than another who doesn’t live or breathe digital services. What’s obvious to you may not be obvious elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know what bandwidth or channel your WiFi router is on, you’re probably poorly placed to assume how people who don’t will understand and act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a tech thing of course. Some of the greatest experts are often the poorest judges of the other needs and experiences of people. Knowing how stuff is made or the details can be very blinding to how other people understand or experience things. Or learn things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost count of the workshops I’ve been in where a technically accomplished person works on an assumption of their users having or easily getting the basics of a complex subject intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is of course to develop a deep understanding of other users and note those common patterns. And to share and centre those stories strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not your own stories or preferences. You may be an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things that annoy me about buying things online. But not all of them at scale will matter. Nor improve how successful an online shop is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And who hasn’t spent time building a feature to resolve a marketing, sales or senior persons pet peeve or vision that had no relevance or impact on most user’s lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for passion projects. Unless you are literally the only person ever going to use it, your user is someone &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; you but not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your experience matters. It can be useful. But it can hold you back or deflect a more important need. You’re a user, just not the user you should design for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Between shifted and removed costs</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many organisations invest in service transformation with the goal to reduce costs or improve efficiency. Be it automating manual tasks, streamlining processes, or cutting out steps that seem unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However these changes can end up just moving costs or effort to another part of the organisation or onto users. Leading to new challenges instead of true efficiencies. And ultimately much worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see a task that takes time and assume removing it will create value. Sometimes, that’s true. Like automating how we test whether a change in code has broken a journey. But in other cases, the cost is not removed—it’s just moved elsewhere. Often, this burden falls on users or other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t always the big stuff. An example I&amp;rsquo;ve suffered recently is a change in packaging. Over Christmas I was in my local shop to look for some nice beer. I found something interesting. But instead of the usual plastic rings or cardboard packaging, the cans were held together with glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right fig-right-gutter" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/dripping.jpeg" alt="An artwork of a family made out of fluff and sticky notes, dripping"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A well-designed service should aim to genuinely remove costs rather than just shift them&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This likely reduced packaging costs, may have had environmental benefits, and let the product have a clean look. But it also made it more prone to falling apart, and shifted the risk to me as the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure the team is celebrating cost savings and sustainability improvements. But they achieved this by pushing inconvenience and risk onto me. Recycled cardboard would have worked just fine. Glue, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a happy customer when it means your savings cost me more when things go wrong. This will inform every purchase I make going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond beer, nowhere is cost-shifting more apparent than in healthcare. While there are some tasks that are better done with active patients, many health services now place an excessive burden on patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients are expected to remember their prescriptions, manage drug interactions, and carry information between appointments and teams. Partial digitisation and service cuts mean that clinicians often don’t have the time or access to the right information, shifting that responsibility to patients instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big efficiency, better systems that record and talk to each other, is left undone. So teams are left with smaller ones. Ones where time is cut down to the bare minimum. People are a bag of symptoms rather than a person in the rush to increase throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the most unwell often burden the highest cost of gluing together a good health service. And anyone with a chronic illness facing doing that for the rest of their life. Ultimately at the cost of jobs, money and health of those very patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A health service might have saved a bit in efficiency or number of appointments offered. But at the cost of the ultimate outcome: the patient&amp;rsquo;s health and ability to live a good life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we design and build products, if we care about our users and the impact of the &amp;ldquo;improvements&amp;rdquo; we make, we need to counteract this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How might we do that&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid simply shifting costs rather than removing them, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and amplify the voices of those affected and talk with users and teams to identify where burdens are being created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the problem properly. Doing root cause analysis can reveal alternative ways to remove, rather than shift, burden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model the true end-cost. If removing a task leads to more customer service calls or increased churn, factor that into the cost-benefit analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set clear red lines. Principles like “no new burden on the user” or “no added complexity” ensure efficiencies don’t come at the cost of user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work and prototype the bigger solutions. Stop accepting that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to share data and start prototyping ways it can be even in smaller sets of services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful product, projects and programmes make informed decisions about what they will and won’t do. A well-designed service should aim to genuinely remove costs rather than just shift them. Without this, efficiency gains come at the cost of worse experiences for users and higher costs elsewhere in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just shift a cost. Remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s catchy. And many people feel that’s what they do. And you’ll be doing it a bit I don’t doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve talked to a service designer over the last few years (or been one) you’ve probably heard some variation on that theme. That the job is mostly convincing other people to let them do their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good ear worm but it’s a bad brain worm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling people that’s what the thing is is setting them up to fail. No one wants a methodological pedant who mostly preaches and rarely practices on a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to hear how they’re doing it all wrong by someone who appears to only say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right fig-right-gutter" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/pink-mess.jpeg" alt="An artwork of pink sticky notes and fluff"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Service design starts in the stony rubbish. That’s where things take root. Not in a perfect world where things are cultivated and manicured&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s something I’ve seen a lot of the last few years in the service design world, then it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of pedantry about what is or is not service design. Or how &amp;ldquo;these aren&amp;rsquo;t the true conditions&amp;rdquo; or this or that. And a lot of people trying to do good work spending too much time arguing about what it is rather than getting on with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people following a &amp;ldquo;preaching and throwing rocks process&amp;rdquo; rather than getting their hands dirty. Spending time “evangelising” rather than just getting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If showing is powerful and telling less so, then it’s about showing how it works. Through doing it rather than talking about doing it. By helping combine various views and helping make better decisions based on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s done by helping teams visualise and talk about complex things. And be able to add their skill set and viewpoints into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s done by ensuring teams are held to account by the users actual expectations and experiences. And weaving those viewpoints into business and technical discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it&amp;rsquo;s hard. But it&amp;rsquo;s done by doing not telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now people might say, yeah that’s what they meant. But is it what’s happening? If 90% of the work is advocating for service design it must be done by doing. And not preaching and explaining the theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it really is just convincing other people of the approach then it’s a pyramid scheme not a path to better products and services. So it’s got to be mostly about facilitating and designing how services are offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better products and services are made by getting stuck in. Not by disappearing and working on futures that’ll never happen. Or by preaching a set of conditions to do work that’ll never materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service design starts in the stony rubbish. That’s where things take root. Not in a perfect world where things are cultivated and manicured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No service design is not mostly convincing other people to do service design. It’s by using tools and techniques to make services and products better. Designing services together. Not preaching about the conditions or what jobs are called.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in a few places where there’s been talk about justifying the cost of UCD and similar roles. At first glance it’s a fair point. What impact do we have? How are we helping? How do we ensure we’re doing the best we can?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question rarely gets asked in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the ways I note the health of an organisation or profession. If the organisation is complex or complicated, but the measures and patience for a profession to make an impact don’t reflect that, it’s a bad sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it takes years to build anything. And years more to know if you’ve made things better. It’s unlikely you’ll see the impact you expect due to other bigger cultural problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall working at an organisation and hearing a director ask teams to capture examples and case studies to illustrate the impact teams have made. But making an impact on things like child poverty, whether people can get a GP appointment or the rate of reoffending isn’t something 1 person is going to easily impact in a team.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src="/images/having a chat at the workshop.jpeg" alt="A rough pastel drawing of figures with one pressing a phone on a persons ear"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;You’re not claiming that you’ve solved child poverty. But you can say you’ve make it clearer to get help. That satisfaction has increased or that people are more likely to find the information they need first time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, a whole service will struggle to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that particular ask was put out, everyone was on the backfoot. It was not about building a culture of caring about impact, showing and telling how people’s work helps. It was to justify, backfill and escape a cull immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we’re honest most designers and UCD staff are rarely powerful or influential enough to own the outcomes that get measured. Nor do they have the freedom to accelerate when their designs get made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be less so in some problem spaces and in individual products or smaller teams. Where there is a closer relationship to doing some work and seeing it out there in the world making changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in complex and complicated organisations it’s impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue lies in that complexity. But it’s also because we can never directly claim updating a website or a flow is really going to be the single thing that changed some numbers for a complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child poverty is just too big. And drawing an honest line between 1 strand of work to that is going to be impossible or a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately when the question is being asked about impact it’s often a budget thing. Justify the cost. And actual evidence for those big outcomes are going to be problematic at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Don’t&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big believer that you’re wasted in proving your impact in these situations. Don’t tell, show. Do it by doing the work to make things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get drawn into trying to claim a slice of a complex outcome and then the mental gymnastics required to pretend you really did all that yourself and it wasn’t a system wide thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you can’t not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Try and reverse the ask&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re getting someone asking to justify how a profession makes an impact there’s a chance a decision has already been made. Maybe someone needs to sleep well with it and are throwing a fake bone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe it’s a legit ask. If so, ask them what they think. What’s their expectations? Sometimes money was given with expectations and that hasn’t aligned to what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in and seen enough teams try and make an impact but getting chance to bed in is so tough because so many other things have to change to allow it. And maybe those things aren’t well understood higher up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might also be because people inherit decisions and teams. And may not know what they’re meant to get back. Or it could be that they don’t know what impact looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mechanic will know what sounds and things happen when an engine runs smooth. And when it doesn’t. Sometimes people don’t know if they’re getting the right signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Do the groundwork and know how your outputs contribute to the outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help show impact do the work to show how a role or roles contributes to outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about why &lt;a href="/2023/10/27/why-we-design-forms.html"&gt;designers design forms&lt;/a&gt;. Have a model like this for your business and what elements you contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it quality, innovation, experience, efficiency, risk, profit etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help yourself and your teams out by creating a basic model of those big, broad outcomes at the top and the common outputs and things you do and visualise how the small things you do impact the big things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style="margin-bottom:1rem;overflow-x:auto;"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Broad Outcome&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Smaller Outcome&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Design Output/Action&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td rowspan="4"&gt;Reduce number of calls to support team&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reduce onboarding-related support queries by 15%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Improve in-app onboarding flow with clearer step-by-step guidance&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Increase usage of self-help resources by 30%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Design a more prominent and useful help section&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reduce form drop-offs by 20%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Redesign long forms reducing duplication, redundancy and improving usability&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reduce error-related support calls by 25%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Provide more user-friendly, actionable error messages and recovery steps&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you can tell the story of smaller impacts and wins but create the thread between that and the bigger outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Get good at finding smoke signals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a model being crafted ensure you and your teams get good at identifying smaller, quicker signals that something’s making an impact or potentially contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only focus on smaller impacts than those massive outcomes. But also quicker signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve worked on recently is working with the an organisation to define what it means by increasing quality. By doing this I could give a name to several different components. It’ll take a longer time to measure and understand if the product we’re going to release has done this. But we can cheaply check elements of it as a quick smoke signal that things look like they’re getting better. That we’ve made an impact in a much smaller way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If quality has 12 ingredients, can we see we’ve made 2-3 happen? Or made it stronger?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Talk about it all the time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know how you do stuff and what outcomes they support you need to  talk about it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure all activity has clear threads to why we’re doing work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round of research? It’s about derisking a policy landing wrong. Or maybe it’s about ensuring we reduce calls to contact centres. Or maybe it’s about exploring new ways of working that will lead to xyz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s even smaller scale. It’s about derisking a policy by just getting everyone aware and on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to talk. And to sow the seeds of contribution all the time. Even when it’s collaborative. To own your fair share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you can bet your ass other professions and teams are taking credit. As they should. But so should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not claiming that you’ve solved child poverty. But you can say you’ve make it clearer to get help. That satisfaction has increased or that people are more likely to find the information they need first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few summers ago when MPOX (previously called monkeypox) broke out I did this in very cheap way. It was an emergency ask and I helped a bunch of clinicians, call centre teams and tech people come together and make the heath protection teams response more sustainable and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did the work I reported up and out at all times. Starting with daily notes and then weeknotes to directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ensured that directors and teams knew it was the work I was doing that contributed to other things they heard about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my work to get people together, map out the existing service and insights and help plot 3 or 4 changes we could make. Another team put the solution in place. But without the design and facilitation that didn’t happen. So I could (justifiably) claim that credit and my part to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got early estimates of the time saved and I shared those too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This built up the links between other work and my work. Between what I do and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later a very UCD sceptical director calls myself and my director in for a chat. They had more they want to do together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was easier to then build a relationship and “justify” the sorts of roles and how they work as they’d seen it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Make sure everyone in the profession knows the impact we have and how to explain it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a design team is small it’s easier to do this. To tell stories and keep the story going. As a team grows or you’re in a big organisation where ways of working can be so different everywhere do the work to make sure people are mapping how they contribute through small contributions to bigger outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teach, train and hold people accountable. Talk about it a lot. Give people the tools to talk about it. And do so before you need to justify your impact as a profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Find friends and the right places to make an impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the sweet spot between what your organisation really cares about and where your skills and those of your teams can really contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find friends and allies. Be okay with less ideal situations that let you demonstrate value. And exploit those to build the relationships and trust you in need to make an impact. And it be easier to demonstrate that value next time&lt;/p&gt;
