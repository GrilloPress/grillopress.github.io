    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank holiday. Kept things pretty chilled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day reviewing the activity on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a call with the programme to review activity. Put things into place for analysis. Combed over some numbers and cautioned for no conclusions. Some numbers weren’t pretty. But we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough users through the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made a point of getting the programme director to commit to an in-person design session. Idea being, get everyone in a room. Review data. Co-design solutions and share issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, we have three current concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we letting the zoomers&amp;rsquo; zoom and the readers&amp;rsquo; read?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are people able to find their NHS number?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are people able to authenticate? (on scale)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re too early to come to a position on any of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a Thunderbird team retro. Talked about issues holding us back and things we did well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After retro talked a little about future issues to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the cookie elaboration for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elaborated a bit more on the service’s cookie solution. A solution we had intended to pursue wasn’t quite a fit this second. Had to dig through some other privacy policy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a few questions for the landing page. Resources for professionals etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated to a final release of a potential service prototype. Regardless if the service is a goer, feel pretty happy with the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DDC UX team meeting. Our lead researcher went through how we had been using hotjar. In Alpha, Private and now public beta. Limitations and workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with the NHS account designers afterwards. Had a good laugh about a few things. Talked about the NHS and branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished the day having a long catch up with Emma James. Talked through content design. Question design. Content/interaction flows and the weekly design huddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma agreed to talk through some of the stuff she had been working on at the huddle. Announced it on the design slack channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day with a quick technical review for the service’s cookie banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleaned up some design board stuff. Dean and David volunteered to give an update on the NHSUK redesign work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had an assignment review with the service owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with Jordan, a graduate user researcher I am helping career manage. Planned in a performance review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also caught up with Sam. Graduate content designer (who dabbles with some interaction design). She was prototyping some questions up. Great to see her grow in confidence. From building her first prototype on the GDS course to using the NHS kit in the NHS account team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked to Emma over slack about input validation and error messages for NHS numbers. Sharing some stuff we found out in research. Then talked about user confusion with national insurance numbers and NHS numbers. Good chat through important stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went through error messaging hypotheses. Algorithm that you can use to validate NHS numbers. We agreed that there needs to be a standard approach to NHS numbers going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrote up a quick hypotheses for when a user enters a national insurance number into the NHS number field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewed my designs for a “review your answers” page. Felt unhappy with it on mobile and made a few tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked over to BWP for the design huddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a great session. Particularly enjoyed talking through interaction/content design problems as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Leeds designers’ huddle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NHSDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NHSDigital&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DoTheWords?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DoTheWords&lt;/a&gt; sharing a gnarly content and interaction design challenge to make it simpler for people to sign in to NHS services online &lt;a href="https://t.co/GAO74YPJkO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GAO74YPJkO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Matt Edgar (@mattedgar) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattedgar/status/1002210556290486278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started Friday with a design backlog review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided some personal review feedback for members of the team. For their career managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product backlog review with service owner. Talked through some concerns and future design work. Not tons on the horizon. Though that always seems to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch in the sun. Caught up with some recent ex-Thunderbird team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit of design work on leaflets and forms. We have a creeping set of landing page requirements that is worrying me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started early.  Created two prototypes. Exploring different cookie consent banners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One with a simplified yes/no choice. Another that gave users more control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared the prototypes with the rest of the “Cookie cutters” for feedback. Rather than chuck some hypotheses and proto-personas at the group, I arranged a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared the “NHS number” prototype with that team as well. Got given the analytics code to add and talked through research options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my daily standup with Thunderbird I had the research planning call. Discussed the hypotheses behind the two versions of the cookie banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hadn’t ever worked with the researchers before. You take for granted the chemistry you have with people. But the team was great and we quickly got on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked through the ideas. Shaped the research plan. Some questions were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What users thought the banner was about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What (if anything) they thought the banner was asking them to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How they interacted with the banner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did they know what cookies were?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much did they know about GDPR?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which prototype model did they prefer? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did they understand they were agreeing to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What they understood by &amp;ldquo;third-party&amp;rdquo; and other terms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to get people with a range of digital skills through a pop-up in a library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers, Ana and Antonia, thought testing a third prototype would help them. So I got to crafting it while they shared the updated research plan in the Cookie cutter slack group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumped onto verifying the service for go-live. Caught an issue with the footer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started an interaction flow in Sketch for the NHS number prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took a call with programme about cookies and analytics for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked to a developer on the gov.uk slack about why they needed their NHS number. They’d asked in a channel where you could find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the day heard back from the researchers with the pop-up results. We got six people through. Between the two concepts, users preferred having more immediate control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users understood what was being asked of them. And had heard about &amp;ldquo;cookies&amp;rdquo;. But they felt somewhat confused over the implications of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this issue was that I had thrown the words together. And they weren’t great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue was that we were exploring the need for consent to advert placement/tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where you are asking people a simpler question, the binary yes/no option would excel. But, we had a scenario where we had finer grained layers. And as such, people liked that to be transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next iteration was then to fold in what we had learnt about simplifying the language. As well as drilling further into how to let people make an informed decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dug into the cookies we were using. How to categorise them to something that’s easy to understand and doesn’t rely on web concepts or web terms. Tried to simplify things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shifted to terms we thought were more commonly understood. Things like “social media”. (Yes, still too vague&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explored addition concepts like “just in time” consent. This was more of a proof of concept. Not something we tested immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished off the NHS number service interaction flow. Added more detail on errors and loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the final feedback on pop-up sessions for the latest prototypes. Progress on simplifying the concepts we are trying to get across to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our design worked well. But we had an issue again with the language. Recent Facebook and Cambridge Analytica stories changed how people perceived a few terms. Moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved the cookie banner based on the user feedback. Packaged up the prototype for implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the morning met up with a colleague from London to talk navigation. Love chatting to Graham but don’t get to talk face to face much. Nice change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met up with Ben. Took the opportunity to grab lunch. Talked through some stuff we were working on. Respecting context in interaction design amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked to Adam from the Cookie cutter crew. Caught up with the implementation of the cooke banner. He&amp;rsquo;d made great progress on two versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said hello to an NHS graduate I met during the GDS course. Caught up how she was. What she is moving onto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with Ruth the product owner for the new NHS number service. Talked through where the service could live if it is a goer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared the wireflow kit I used to create the NHS number interaction flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the day talked to a colleague from the NHSUK CMS team. About the prototype kit I made to explore their designs. Crafted up a starter kit for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not announced until Friday, the Thunderbird team put the service live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things healthy and good to go. Nice moment. Particularly for a small team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took a bit of time to go deeper into the error validation and messaging for the NHS number prototype. With a small window until MVP it’s key to explore the end to end journey. Dead-ends and things we left too late on my current service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked to a content designer colleague about help text and dropdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared some stuff we found in user testing. She also suggested some stuff. Improvements for the service and new prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got sight of some of the launch day comms. It had changed quite a bit from last time. The plan was to announce the service in every national newspaper. As well as places like radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of speakers for the weekly design meetup had had to drop out. Life got in the way. I presented on a recent issue. Had planned for the chat to end with a sketching session. But debate and discussion took us to a more strategic than interface level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/thunderbird go live.jpg" alt="Group of colleagues standing in front of a whiteboard celebrating launching a national service"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Thunderbird team celebrating go live!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleagues collected newspaper cuttings and shared where they had seen the service advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did a little more on error messages. This time some validation rules for the prototype and then wording on end-pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped the Thunderbird team on a range of issues and queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chased up on some questions I had asked. Given some content for the service but bounced it back asking for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went for lunch with the team and later in the day some drinks. Celebrated launching a service with a small, talented and motivated team.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivery Centre UX team update. Caught up in a meeting beforehand so turned up a few minutes late. Always enjoy hearing what colleagues are up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on got a very direct design requirement. One that came with the caveat that without it, no live service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it was a solution we had no idea of the impact of that tried to solve a problem we had little to no evidence for. Pushed back but got told in no uncertain terms it wasn&amp;rsquo;t up for negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knocked me for six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafted up some HTML for a new privacy notice for the Thunderbird team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a great discussion with the Thunderbird developers later about an API we use. A small chat with the team. Thrashing out and balancing user experience and technical possibility. A great team co-design session amongst a sea of uncertainty and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those moments you feel like as a team you could conquer anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catch up meeting with the user research team first thing. Talking through some things that will be coming our way. Mitigating some issues going forward and planning the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got an answer back RE: cookies and stuff for the 25th. Plot thickens a little but a clearer choice forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got asked a question. In light of the requirement on Monday I felt the need to state my opinion. Without reservation. Took my time to highlight precedence and GDS standards. Squashed the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felt empowered I must admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw the impact of Monday&amp;rsquo;s design requirement&amp;rsquo;s on the service when a few colleagues opened the most recent prototype. It was a little bit like watching a car crash. It was a brutal insight into the confusion the design change will have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I thought I was losing sleep over the issue before, this really worried me. On the train home I started drafting notes on how to reverse this requirement. Or mitigate some of the confusion it was causing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day finishing off an email highlighting my case against the requirement. Built a case. Laid out the various ways forward. And prayed the email landed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped kickstart a small project team &amp;ldquo;cookie cutters&amp;rdquo; swarm on stuff for the 25th May and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumped on various issues throughout the day. Lots of pivots and changes. Many unneeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared the ground work for a different project prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting with lead researcher and product owner on new &amp;ldquo;NHS number&amp;rdquo; project. Talked about a few issues. Doing one thing per page and the central hypothesis behind the first prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked through something I had crafted together on the train into Leeds. Benefit of having a prototyping kit where you can glue things together to test and explore ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changed up how I built this one in response to picking through the GDS kit. Doing more of the routing stuff on the server rather than on the frontend. Will see if it makes it more flexible for me or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to jump onto an urgent call. At the end of the call reiterated my points about the requirement I disagreed with. Laid out my position. Final decision was with the senior responsible officer (SRO) later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran across to the NHS Digital design away day. Heard lots of interesting stories. Saw lots of great designs in response to many challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got to meet up with lots of friends and the cool people from NHS BSA again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really enjoyed the guest talk from the NHS BSA team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw a pattern throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those that shared their work early and often had a maturity and coherence to their work compared to those that didn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s the key to being a good designer. It&amp;rsquo;s hard. It&amp;rsquo;s scary. But sharing your work will make it better. Particularly before you hit that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable with this&amp;rdquo; stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to have a great chat over lunch as I had to jump onto another urgent call. Bit upset. But that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when you are launching a national service in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a great day though. Always feel sad when the day is over. Never enough time to talk to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walk back to the train station had a good chat with a colleague or two. Issues shared. Truths told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my train back I heard news about the hard requirement I emailed about on Wednesday was being reversed. Moment of great relief. Promised to investigate the concern that caused the requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can stop losing sleep over it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also had a good chat about cookies and GDPR and what stuff needs to happen to explore the impact of that too. Plans made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished off the first prototype for the new &amp;ldquo;NHS Number&amp;rdquo; project. Pretty happy with it all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafted up some screens for the cookie project. Wrote up and modelled some proto-personas. Evaluated and ranked some needs. Balanced user needs, business requirements and potential clinical risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your website visitors may be having a heart attack. Or their child is struggling to breathe you have a duty not to get things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explored the screens against various websites and pages. Judging the solution against different styles of page. And in different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared preliminary stuff with the cookie cutters. Tweaked a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day then went a bit south. Ended up watching my wife connected to all sorts of machines and tests. Frustrating and very long day. All fine in the end. At times it didn&amp;rsquo;t sound like it would end well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank holiday. Spent it in Cheshire. Sadly felt really ill for most of the day :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked into an issue with our analytics during public beta. We need to be clearer on capturing consent. Right now we don’t capture it quite to the standard needed (Post May 25th). There is an organisation-wide solution but it may not actually be ready for our cutoff. Asked a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweaked a couple of things on a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got back to a colleague who had some questions about how we had evolved our site&amp;rsquo;s navigation. Hypothesis driven design to the rescue again. Every change we’ve used a set way of recording changes and the reasons for them. You can find more info on &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html"&gt;how we do Hypothesis driven design in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketched some potential solutions. Issue being how we handle important offline forms for very specialist groups. Mocked a few things up. Trying to find something that is sustainable. Something that can deal with shifting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a meeting with the programme and NHSUK team about progress for go live. After that did a technical review of the pages. Caught a couple of small issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked a little on my part of the &amp;ldquo;Making UX Agile&amp;rdquo; talk. Emma Harvey (Head of Product) and I got asked if we could take the show on the road to Agile Manchester. Got told we had extremely positive reviews at UX in the City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential audience was quite different.  So, although the narrative remained similar, I wanted to nail down the main takeaways. See Thursday for those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Manchester for &amp;ldquo;Agile Manchester&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get into the swing of the event due to other work stuff. Was there with my delivery manager and she also had quite a few things to attend to as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to duck out of the keynote to make an iteration on a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught an interesting talk from John Clapham called &amp;ldquo;Kaizen to Karõshi - sustainable pace and performance in teams&amp;rdquo;. Effectively, how and why people burn out. How agile can actually be an excuse for some bad behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made me pause for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look after yourself, and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-presented after lunch. Our talk was called &lt;a href="http://agilemanchester.net/2018/sessions/index.php?session=503"&gt;Making UX truly agile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about our journey. Starting from an agile-ish team but with some massive silos. To a well-connected, lean agile design into dev team. We&amp;rsquo;re facing new challenges everyday. But the team feels able to rise to the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the only designer in the room. We had a mixture of developers, delivery staff and agile coaches. I asked how many people had experience of working with designers they felt were &amp;ldquo;agile&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo;. I got one half hand-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Room to improve designers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main points in the talk were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on the quality of conversations you have, much more than the quantity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it easy to say things of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go where the conversations are happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t do things - like stand ups etc. - because “that’s how we do things here”. Make sure they’re adding value. If they’re not, change it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk less, say more. Listen twice as much as you speak up and when you do, make sure it is productive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it feels like it would be awkward or difficult to talk about an issue, talk about it twice as much. Get things in the open. Get things cleaned up and sorted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you get a gut feeling like “really need to catch up with X”. Do it. Don’t delay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this and have less &amp;ldquo;WTF?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I told&amp;rdquo; moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. You&amp;rsquo;ll never make design agile on your own&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are the sole designer or have one designer in the team, you&amp;rsquo;ll need help. Empower your team to think about the user. Everyone impacts on the design. In exploration or implementation. Get everyone involved. Make it everyone&amp;rsquo;s problem with yourself (or your designer) as the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce user outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk about it a lot and use the same language all the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk about users beyond the &amp;ldquo;UI&amp;rdquo; stuff. Non-functional things like security and performance are UX issues too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invite everyone to user research and design stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactively engage and elaborate design things with the development team. Be it your BA, product owner, developer or whatever. Co-craft the implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to not only &amp;ldquo;keep ahead&amp;rdquo; of the development, but see what&amp;rsquo;s coming up. See what hasn&amp;rsquo;t been thought about. And spend less time telling people &amp;ldquo;you didn&amp;rsquo;t implement that right&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving you time and energy to reinvest in the service or product you are building. And your own mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Treat your design process like a design problem. Create, iterate, test, iterate, test, iterate, test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master your design workflow. Be sure how to take a problem and turn it into an outcome for your user. Make your process repeatable so you can keep iterating your design and iterating your service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work out a simple stepped flow on how you finish a piece of design work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add phases you&amp;rsquo;d like or should have (document, design review etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use your process. Iterate. Test. Explore what works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of building a process, &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/01/08/kanban_for_interaction_design.html"&gt;I wrote up more about how we used a Kanban board to do just that in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a process ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What works?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could you do better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is too zoomed in? What am I obsessing over?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is too high level? What is important but isn&amp;rsquo;t being captured?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where am I holding things up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I finishing things before starting the next lot of work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where and when do I get design tasks from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to share your process. Talk about it to everyone who will listen. Share it early and often. It&amp;rsquo;s the only way to get better at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. There will always be a tension between design and delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is okay. Design tries to get things right. And delivery is about making a thing real. There is always a need to balance making the right thing and making something real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll never know for sure if something works until it is used by real people. So get something out in front of a user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being agile as a designer, or doing agile design, is about finding that path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lead developer announced at standup he would be moving on. Really gutted to hear. He&amp;rsquo;s been great to work with and I will miss him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prepare for go live we had loads of attention and requests flying in. Very hectic day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it at that :)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the week with some urgent medical care. My own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dealing with that, jumped on some frontend tickets for the Thunderbird team. Updated the interruption card in the live service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw some mixed results using the latest version of the &amp;ldquo;interruption card&amp;rdquo;. It was either not interrupting enough or people were clicking icons. We had hoped that icons would make the card more arresting. But it has not. If anything, it made it more like a graphical element that people skipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started on updating the error messages for the live service too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished the error messages for pubic beta. Making the service&amp;rsquo;s error messages more actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked in the gov slack for advice. Got &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbQPc_YATKR4h7inHMDvE8OLor7crEGP7f7Qd_QszqA/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;some great practical advice about writing error messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked through screen recordings of the service. Digesting the feedback from the private beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped a colleague help a graduate prepare for an internal interview. Always enjoy helping others see how great they are. But also pushing them further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrote and presented at a show and tell. Great to see the researchers work through their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I updated the wider project on the interruption card and upcoming design work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/research_beta.png" alt="Two user researchers standing in front of a television screen"/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Emma and Katharine bossing it at the show and tell.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked on some more frontend cards for the Thunderbird team. This time SMS messages and emails. Took a chunk of the day. Had other personal stuff to deal with too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got some good news from some recruitment work I had helped lead on earlier in the year. Passed on that good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sent an email to the programme setting out my understanding of what to do for Friday. Took a few phonecalls to uncover requirements and pragmatic approaches going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the day with another call. Explored final content requirements and pragmatic approaches going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the day got asked my opinion on some ministerial feedback. Dug out some stats from the private beta period to back up my position. Things like scroll depth, user journeys etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a few phonecalls to sort a range of issues that sprung out of that. Helped define a few small prototypes that could be of use to explore certain issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked on those for first thing Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished four prototypes. Three for the minister in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sent a final call on the content and offline forms. Got all the content and packaged it up for a baselined prototype for the NHSUK team. Ready for go live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Received some updated terms and conditions for the live service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped a junior colleague go through the process to make changes to the live service. Folding in a small content correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhausting end to a very exhausting week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet another busy week. Something of a pattern for April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started the week finishing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error messages. Form downloads for the offline service. Helping the Thunderbird team update the transactional service with some small tweaks. Bit of career management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped get a grad I met at the GDS training in touch with Thunderbird&amp;rsquo;s talented delivery manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent lunch with a friend from a different team. Ended up in a random Italian place. Talked about the tension of delivery and delivering the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with the service owner. Thrashed out how we are going to help all the teams on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folded in the new HTML email design into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got told I had to use a real life photo on a slack instance. So, used the first one in my phone. Got trolled hard. Obviously just too saucy. Too Mills and Boon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="noir right"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/mills_and_boon.png" alt="A joke mock-up of a Mills and Boon romance novel called 'Kanban at midnight' feating Andrew Duckworth's face"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Available in all good bookstores&amp;hellip; Thanks Dean ;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lost count of the amount of people who told me the photo made me look fatter. Thanks. I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent some time with the user researchers. Ever since we had to move offices, the whole team hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to sit together. Although Slack helps. For some people you need to get together face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked through the private beta findings. We used &lt;a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html"&gt;&amp;ldquo;System Usability Scale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; as well as a comprehension survey. Great usability scores. SUS scores place the service in the top 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehension is a worry. There was a recent phrase change that we can point to as causing a drop in comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoyed going through the screen recordings. Will build the findings into a show and tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with communications teams from various parts of the organisation. Working out how to help coordinate any old content and how that gets updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talked to a GDS designer about their prototyping kit. Some of the reasoning behind certain design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototyping kit is a tool that brings patterns into life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, less is often more. If you have too many patterns, or too low a bar for a pattern you increase the potential for teams to put in place things that are going to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, too few, or too high a bar for a pattern, then people will do what they need to do to get the job done right now. Often at the expense of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got asked to produce something for the minister. Asked for clarity on a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a meeting with the service owner and content designer. Went through the transactional service. Talked errors, issues to implementation, emails and planning for planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met up with a new designer, Alexandra. Working on the buying catalogue. A market place tool for procurement for CCGs. Interesting stuff. Hard challenges. Loads of potential. Was great to meet her. Had many questions about styles, patterns and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also talked about measuring usability and comprehension and how to get that in place for alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large planning meeting with programme, Head of Product and Thunderbird tribe. Pretty productive. No fuss. Bit worried about the level of work I am touching on in the next few weeks. Need to sketch a plan of action. Will pair up with another designer again to get some of the design work into the product for the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside planning had to pull in some changes for a prototype for
the minister. Took a fair chunk of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got invited to talk at Agile Manchester. Taking &lt;a href="http://uxinthecity.net/2018/manchester/sessions/index.php?session=311"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Making UX Agile&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owned a lot of flexitime. Took some. Alongside a little bit of work on the prototype and the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent some time exploring the GDS prototype kit and the inner workings. With the aim to pull in some features into my personal kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learnt lots from all the prototypes I&amp;rsquo;ve built since early October last year for NHS Digital. Important not to get hung up on all the hacks. Also important to learn from them and make life easier next time.&lt;/p&gt;
