    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A service I worked on from March is starting to roll out. When I landed in that team, needing some service design help and leadership, it felt they were the furthest away from every making something real. And now it’s going to get very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all projects there’s lots to reflect on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you learnt. Could do better next time. Friendships and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that went well was the speed of getting up to speed and making an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the team when they had gotten a massive scope shift. With the team reeling a little. But a week after I joined we had an end to end service design and broad hypothesis for what we wanted the service to look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was lots more to do than that. But it felt great making an impact. And the feedback from the team and others was great too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a retro where some people were very nice about me and that impact it made me think about what helped me move things on. To make a useful impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having quite a lot of experience in health and the health and care sector helped. As did working in places learning how to do user centred design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same was also true to how data services work. Even if when I joined the project I wasn’t aware it was going to involve yet another data pipeline and dashboards project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if those things weren’t true. And there have been plenty of projects were they haven’t. A thing that seems to work is being happy to, being active, in putting myself at the heart of facilitating and running meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer in a senior or leading role, your job is to help teams make better decisions. To design the right thing or the thing right. A way to help the team to achieve that is through your craft. But there’s another way. And one particularly important for a service designer. Which is to facilitate and help people run their processes in a user-centred way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do that easier when you put yourself in the heart of the process. By offering to host, hold or run a meeting. From a retro to a planning session and everything in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/at the heart.jpeg" alt="Roy Lichtenstein style panel woman bluring into newspaper, hearts with empty speech bubble"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the project going live, I found myself running meetings from assumption mapping sessions to story mapping and sprint planning sessions. It ensured I was where decisions were made. And that when a decision was made. There was someone reflecting what users’ needed. And that we balanced lots of different perspectives and layers from the service. From policy, tech, users and service teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re feeling a little lost or out of the loop. Or want to make a bigger impact. Make a point of facilitating a meeting. Even a regular one or where there exists a person who sit in that role. It’ll help you be at the heart of things and facilitate the discussions and decisions you’ll need to do service design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your delivery, product or project manager aside and say you want to run something. Either as personal experience or to help mix something up. Whatever it takes. Put the effort in and design the meeting to make it a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally there’s a limit to what’s your role and be careful you’re not taking on work that’s not yours. Be clear you’re being helpful. And that this isn’t about taking notes or making coffee. It’s about making sure you and the team actually designs the service. So if the additional role doesn’t get you there be watchful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams or projects you may also find that the team is reluctant. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re still needing to buy the space to lead things. Sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s just because the team isn&amp;rsquo;t ready. Sometimes that means you need others to take that leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But. Remember that most of service design is orchestration and facilitation of multiple viewpoints consciously designing and making the service. And that happens outside the craft of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the majority of service design happens outside the traditional craft of design. So don’t underestimate being at the heart of things. It’ll get you and your team further faster. Whatever way you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Designing accessible inclusive interfaces is largely beneficial for all users. Making things more usable. And with things being usable. More profitable. More successful. With less failure demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see it in research where people will say they prefer an all at once on 1 page approach but don’t quite understand or get the thing. But when they use the more inclusive approach, and contrary to what they say about clicks or several pages, they go faster and get what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like with anything. Sometimes doing the right thing comes at an cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s okay. That’s the point. It’s about opening things up for all. Not because we’re opening up every wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/wallets.jpeg" alt="lots of wallets"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes that definitely happens. But it’s not always going to be like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t underestimate what opening up your product can do. But it’s not a promise. An accessible product that meets no needs still meets no needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really knowing and taking time to include different voices can be slow. Especially at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s where the cost can be. The time it takes to make sure everyone can use the thing. Or the rework and tweaking of a live product that has to happen for a very subset of your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s thing to a balance when explaining why we make things accessible and inclusive. Be clear about the benefits and strengths of an approach. But don’t sell out inclusion as just a cost saver or money spinner. Sometimes it will cost more. And that’s okay. That’s being human. And making things for all people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same with your minimum legal requirements. They’re a good motivator and benchmark. But also only the most minimal approach. When they become the bar to meet you’ll find you’ll have something meeting the standard but not making everything possible or inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also lower the cost of doing things in an accessible and inclusive way if you do it early. Make your technical foundations something that makes it easy. And if you make being inclusive part of your day to day business. The cost reduces and you have longer to benefit from opening your product or service for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, make your design technically accessible. And take an inclusive approach. It opens things up. But it doesn’t always cost less or open more wallets. Sometimes it’s the right thing to do. And if your principles don’t cost you anything or only make you money. Are they principles anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Codesign is popular thing right now. I’ve heard it from lots of different corners of programme, project and delivery management. Nevermind research and design worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like codesign. It’s about involving the people who are impacted by your design in the design process. Of opening up and evening out power to create. But it’s something that gets said a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of codesign is great. But the reality of how it’s done is often not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of codesign reminds me of the “carnivalesque”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The carnivalesque&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.longwood.edu/staff/mcgeecw/notesoncarnivalesque.htm"&gt;carnivalesque&lt;/a&gt; is a literary and cultural concept. It refers to a temporary mode of subversion and rebellion against social norms and conventions. It originated from the medieval carnival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/pieter-bruegel.jpeg" alt="Carnival and debauchery on show in a painting from Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted during the 16th century."/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Some sort of carnivalesque prototype of a knight going on in a Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carnival was a time when people would gather and engage in fun. Including role reversals, plays, masks, and other forms of transgression. The carnivalesque was a moment in time where roles are reversed. Activities that allowed people to challenge and undermine established hierarchies and power structures. Often by inverting or parodying them. And I&amp;rsquo;m sure often with lots of food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the carnivalesque, the boundaries between sacred and profane, and normal and abnormal are blurred or even reversed. This leads to a sense of liberation and freedom. People are encouraged to express themselves and act outside of their usual roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jokes are had. Fun things take place. You get away from your normal roles and position in things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What codesign and the carnivalesque share&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of codesign and cocreation can be like the carnivalesque in several ways. Both involve a sense of playfulness and experimentation. People are encouraged to explore different ideas and possibilities in a non-conventional way. Like the carnivalesque, codesign and cocreation allow for the breaking down of barriers. And the crossing of boundaries between different disciplines, perspectives, and ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both codesign and cocreation are collaborative processes. They involve a collective effort to create something new and innovative. This collaboration often leads to a disruption of traditional power structures. Participants are given an equal voice and agency in the design process. This is like carnivalesque’s inversion of power hierarchies and its emphasis on collective participation and democratic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True carnivalesque is about unmanaged, unrefined sense of upheaval and fun bubbling under the surface that at any moment can strike hard at false certainties. Getting rid of “that’s how it works”. The carnivalesque is about upending roles. The lords become the peasants and those without power become the lords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of design tools and techniques attempt to use this. None more so than codesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where codesign is the most powerful. Where it recreates this feeling. Where people who are typically excluded from decision making are in the room. The excluded are now making and producing with equal power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The shared flaws and limits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However. As with anything where there’s a transfer of power from those that have it to those that don&amp;rsquo;t. It’s scary. People will ask for “unrealistic things”. A strength. But also a threat. And with any threatening things, a risk to minimise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In organisations that are risk adverse. This happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, codesign doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if it does. It doesn’t actually influence or change anything beyond the moment of fun. Relegated to an hour of hope, exchanged in the long term for pessimism and sense that was a bloody waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that feels dramatic. I’ve seen it plenty. With people faithfully wanting to create the conditions to use what comes out of the chaos of codesign. But those in power having no acceptance or readiness to share power. Or take the fruits of codesign forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams, communities and organisations then learn (rightfully) to distrust those with power. To roll their eyes. To say “we’ve heard this before”. And then they shun the next chance. Turning down any tickets to the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And who’d blame them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the main criticism of carnivaleseque. It isn’t something that creates lasting change. When the carnival closes everything goes back to the way it was. It’s not changing things in a lasting way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codesign offers so much. But be careful that you can live up to the offer you make people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re encouraging your users and communities to get involved. And take a codesign approach. Ask yourself: does your codesign project promise the carnival but leave your participants feeling like clowns?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>User stories aren't the tale for discovery</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the volume of blog posts. Show and tell decks and confluence pages you’d think that writing user needs in user story formats would be the road to success. And though it’s a method that some teams find useful it’s not something I ever advocate. And particularly not when a team is exploring what problems to solve (problem discovery).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User needs in user story format, with their &amp;ldquo;As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]&amp;rdquo; structure, tend to cram needs into a narrow solutionised scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is their point. But to do so they fudge complex things into bite-sized chunks. In discovery or as a vehicle to document the messy reality of a user&amp;rsquo;s needs, it means missing the broader picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user story might encapsulate a single user&amp;rsquo;s immediate desire, but it often fails to reflect the collective needs and aspirations of the entire user base. Or the context and why behind the how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User needs aren’t really a single thing. &lt;a href="https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/research-heresies"&gt;They’re a complex patchwork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User needs in user story formats tend to emphasize &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; over &amp;ldquo;why.&amp;rdquo; They fixate on the solution before understanding the problem. This can lead to a rush toward building features without a deep comprehension of the underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like building things. I like solving problems. So I need to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m solving the right problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address user needs effectively, it’s best to spend some time to uncover the root causes of pain points. And give yourself and the team a pause before getting into solving a problem. This way you avoid just recreating whatever burning platform or missed opportunity you’re trying to patch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem statements can offer a more thoughtful approach by succinctly articulating the core issues and context. Other techniques like journey maps or storyboards that provide a visual narrative of the user&amp;rsquo;s entire experience can also be useful. Helping the team and related teams or stakeholders to share in the uncovering of hidden pain points and opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools help teams to shed light on the emotional, and contextual aspects of user interactions, which can be as critical as the functional ones when in discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly understand and address your user’s actual needs, it is essential to deliver a comprehensive vision, acknowledge the intricate problems users face. A format of user needs in a story format funnels your thinking and articulation into solutions and simple actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth isn’t like this. And when you’re exploring and prioritizing the problems to solve. This isn’t what you need. Teams that do this build the wrong thing. They build solutions that miss the why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple method to knowing whether you should write user needs like this is … can you and every member of your team explain in detail how your user thinks and how they act in a given circumstance? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not. Leave the user story format behind. Leave that format for development of the solution. Not the storytelling of what your user needs and how they act. And get better at writing and sharing richer tales of your users and what they need from you and your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really getting into cooking dishes with a wok recently. Learning new recipes and the tool. It recently sprung about because a member of the family has been found to be allergic to latex heavy foods. Things like tomatoes. That meant all the curries and pasta dishes I had mastered were out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through lots of trial and error I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt plenty. And got lots of tips through YouTube too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking for the family is often a refuge for me. Unlike work, it&amp;rsquo;s a small time bound thing I can easily share with others. Digital transformation projects take years. Egg fried rice takes 5 minutes*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I found important was keeping the wok hot. And I mean REALLY hot. Both when frying rice or vegetables. But also when deep frying things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve felt I&amp;rsquo;ve got a better handle on how to keep things sizzling. Techniques to cool things down. But also, most importantly for me, how not to crowd the pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels really counter-intuitive, but you can often cook faster by frying in 2 smaller batches than all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to fry lots at once the lack of room makes things steam and take longer to crisp up. It also makes things stickier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What too much is&amp;hellip; is not a concrete thing. And as I learnt to use a wok correctly, often discovered too late. But over time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked out the balance by eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day at work on a project not quite hitting the right tempo, it dawned on me we had crowded things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject was complex. But we had a large team. Multiples of each profession. Created from 2 projects merging. Instead of speeding things up. We had crowded things out so that taking the lead on things was harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got so bad at 1 point, it felt that only a few of us was doing anything at all. There were so many silent people. So many experienced people seemingly reporting back no progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other factors. As an organisation we had made reaching our users difficult. That played a big part. Lots of stopping to fill each other in or to give context. Some clashing perspectives on the same ideas. But that would have been easier if there had been less of us to agree anything before we took an approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real momentum only really happened when we were our smallest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t new. Lots has been written about the &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-small-teams-are-better-than-big-ones"&gt;benefits of small teams&lt;/a&gt;. But we had created the conditions to overcrowd ourselves as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had become too hard to hear each voice. To be clear about who was doing what and what to do next. There were just too many of us for us to be agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcrowding is not just a numbers thing. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not just how many pizzas feeds a team. Problems vary too much for that to be true. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on teams of different sizes where the tipping point is different. Either on balance of roles or the type of work that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons something slows down and doesn&amp;rsquo;t get going. One cause could be that you&amp;rsquo;ve overcrowded your pan. Either with too many people trying to do the same thing. Or stopping each other because there&amp;rsquo;s too many people to take responsibility. Either way, it&amp;rsquo;s something I have a better sense of for the next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful to balance your teams so they have just the right amount of people in them. Don&amp;rsquo;t overcrowd the pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*assuming we&amp;rsquo;re talking about just frying the egg and rice that is!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A researcher in another gov department recently messaged about tips for choosing what discovery to go with next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this was an interesting question. There&amp;rsquo;s many ways to go forward. And context can change this a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I find myself in a similar situation I like to create frameworks within the team. Myself, product, programme whoever on what factors we&amp;rsquo;d use to decide as a team that something&amp;rsquo;s worth looking into more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just what we could do. But what will help make a decision. And the organisation a better decision about what to do next. Even if that&amp;rsquo;s just ourselves about the direction of the service we&amp;rsquo;re providing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some factors I use in a that framework are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;User impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is this area gonna improve things? And how likely is the change going to be welcomed and embraced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Business impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is this gonna chime with a benefit or impact to the organisation? [grasp an opportunity, save money, reduce cost, improved specific outcomes]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strategic alignment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this thing have strategic buy-in or alignment? If not, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean don&amp;rsquo;t do it. Just that&amp;rsquo;s a factor in how much effort it&amp;rsquo;ll be to get people to buy into this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ease to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this something we can do? And find out about? Or does it include working across teams and organisations. Again. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean don&amp;rsquo;t do it. Just be brutally honest that the more of a system you have to understand the harder it&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can we name the decision it&amp;rsquo;ll help make?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we know what decision we need to make. Then a discovery is really focused, well scoped and easy to shape. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t we may need to think about it again. Or try explaining it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Feasibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How likely is it the things we&amp;rsquo;re looking into are things we can solve? The NHS has wasted millions on discoveries and alphas into things that&amp;rsquo;ll take billions to solve etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we trying to boil the ocean when it might make sense to start somewhere smaller?&lt;/p&gt;
