    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When trying to get users for your service it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to outline the stages of interest people go through. And what strategies you might want to use to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies whether you’re selling a thing. Creating a health service. Or building a service the user must legally complete under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a quick framework to help guide me. To help myself and my team be clear about the shifts we need to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about how users start your service, or buy your product, you’ll find the following stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-container"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;User stages of interest&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Interest level&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Actively looking for a/the service to meet a need&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Proactive interest&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Someone looking for new shoes, person looking for a doctors phone number etc.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Open to a/the service to meet a need&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Inactive interest&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Someone who knows they need new shoes but feeling busy or not looking right now, Someone who knows they need to do something about a health issue but not sure what or if something exists so do nothing&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Not thinking about a/the service to meet a need&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Inactive disinterest&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Someone who think their shoes are fine and not thinking about them, Someone who thinks the health problem is just age or something that’ll be fine in time&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Don’t think a/the service would meet their need &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Proactive disinterest &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Someone who is thinking / conscious of new shoes or alternatives but doesn’t want them, Someone who knows a new model of car exists but doesn’t want it, Someone who thinks a health service would be a waste of time for them&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully selling things is about making it as easy as possible for those actively looking. Or to stand out as the best option for those people. And then trying to shift the inactive people into some activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with inactive interest, it&amp;rsquo;s about showing the possibility of your product to improve things. To answer their need. That it is possible to do THAT thing. Or solve THAT issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with inactive disinterest, it&amp;rsquo;s about getting them to pay attention and answer a question. Are you sure this isn’t for you? Don’t you need this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For proactive disinterest. That can sound like a terrible place. But you’ve got people’s notice. Maybe your service isn’t for them. But it’s a chance to do something. It’s harder to shift their perceptions because they come with some. But understanding those people means you can tailor your service to respond to what they currently think your service lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/all the people all the places.jpeg" alt="Artwork. Many people in blue. Searching looking for things. Looking for all the people and places amongst mountains of sticky notes - By Andrew Duckworth"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask yourself. Do we need to reach people or convert those we&amp;rsquo;ve reached?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing harder for services than the unengaged. The people we find hard to reach. To influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many urgent and emergency health services you find a lot of proactive disinterest. That is. People who very consciously don’t think a service will meet their needs. Many examples in health are because they don’t want to go to hospital. So they’ll look for other services to meet their need if possible. Or try and do nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South East London, a team I worked with found that to be true of a lot of their patients for their “virtual ward” offer. They had a lot of patients who were in a thin line between seriously ill enough for hospital care, but safe enough and insistent enough that they didn’t want hospital. Traditionally the patient would be cajoled into hospital. Or worse left at risk in the community or with family. But with a “virtual ward” approach they could be given the care they’d expect in hospital. With the access to drugs, diagnostics and consultant care, but in the comfort of their own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service now had something they could offer. To nudge those with proactive disinterest in going to getting the care from hospital. Something in the middle. And once care started. If things were really unsafe at homes a relationship had started. And patients were much more willing to talk their options through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not everything has to be as involved as reinventing your service. Sometimes it’s the slow drip work of making obvious that &amp;ldquo;people like you become their best self with THIS&amp;rdquo;. Getting your main proposition out there. And if that doesn’t work, working out from the actively disinterested what it is that your service is lacking. Be it clarity or specific things you can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are actively looking or considering things also have different modes or ways they search for information too. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://boxesandarrows.com/four-modes-of-seeking-information-and-how-to-design-for-them/" target="_blank"&gt;an interesting model here by Donna Spencer about those seeking modes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re mapping out how your service or product works. Make sure to visualise the routes to using your service from these states. How are you helping shift people to meet their needs using your service? What are your tactics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a 2by2 grid can be useful. Use it to write in the tactics or solutions you have for shifting people. Do this as a team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="/images/interest activity 2by2 grid.jpg" alt="2 by 2 grid with one side having interest, the other activity with arrows between to highlight where the shifts to be made are"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A format like this will make it easier to talk about but also show you where you might be lacking. It can be easy to over optimise for people to buy. But your problem might be that you’re not getting people interested first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find this in government a lot. Where most of the work is making the service easy to use. With little work on how we get people to know about the thing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself. Do we need to reach people or convert those we&amp;rsquo;ve reached?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that the time people spend in these phases isn&amp;rsquo;t equal. The length of time someone will stomach actively looking but finding nothing is not long. And differs on the level of importance to them. People will rarely stay active for long. So you have to be quick there to get the sale or convert a disbeliever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People also get things wrong. And a potential user whose tried something and failed will very quickly think your service can&amp;rsquo;t exist. Or is a load of rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you may have very different users or types of people either starting or referring people to your service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whether you’re trying to sell something, offering a health or government service, make sure to understand the phases your potential users go through. And map out how well your service meets those phases. And the things you could change to shift people to meet their needs using your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was writing up &lt;a href="/2023/10/27/why-we-design-forms.html"&gt;why designers design forms&lt;/a&gt; I started thinking about the times I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in large organisations to convince people about design. The time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent making it easier for teams to learn about design. And the process of it and how to use designers to make things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in any sort of government or enterprise organisation there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance there are some designers. Some &amp;ldquo;UX&amp;rdquo; types somewhere. And some enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most convincing and impactful things I found was showing (and not telling) the value of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, not going around and doing a presentation about a particular design practice and telling people to respect it. But making it and the value it brings to life for people by doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/sharing the good word.jpg" alt="Cartoon. A duck standing in front of a presentation saying 'hire more of us'. The presentation slide says 'everything you do is stupid and what I do is smart' - by Andrew Duckworth"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t do this. Don&amp;rsquo;t be that person when trying to convince people that they need your profession&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving the face of a director in a pinch. Making something better. Making things more efficient in a crisis. I&amp;rsquo;ve used lots of those moments to &lt;a href="/2021/03/19/win-space-to-design.html"&gt;win the space to do design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about teams and services that don’t have much budget? Or still don’t believe a thing you’re selling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t always get to put designers and people in the spots that most need design. But you get to create powerful communities of practice and sharing. Often because it’s damn hard to make change happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked in a local hospital. There was no UX team. Only people who cared about doing things right. Or making interfaces. A blend of UX, UI and frontend people. As well as patient advocates and quality improvement people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built a semi-structured community. A group of people who helped each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked at NHS Digital I helped look after our design community. Growing and sustaining it so it could support any team with advice and guidance. And when I led design in UKHSA, I helped support the UCD team rethink it’s content design community meetups. Particularly in the light of much smaller numbers of designers post-covid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as help grow and nuture the designers. These communities are also great places to show and share the value of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can do it by running design reviews almost as a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this I mean opening up regular time as a profession or group of designers and researchers where you allow teams to share their work and you give them your feedback. On things to improve now to what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of just doing it between designers. Letting teams come with their products and ideas and supporting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be in the same community space or activities. For example, ensuring the community events have some regular space for other people to rock up. Or it could be in dedicated times to open things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At NHS Digital the data team did this with people working on data visualisation and it was a way of support teams beyond those the team could directly work with day to day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of this to design within an organisation is it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps grow experience and understanding of design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes some things better than they would have been&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gets teams to understand what to do next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes the case for more permanent support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value for your designers or design community space is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more content / volunteers to talk and speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeps things fresh with new projects or teams arriving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps people learn how to be pragmatic and less dogmatic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lets people share the value of their experience and craft with those who need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In UKHSA we helped a team designing things for data from labs to improve. To see the value of interaction and content design. And we helped them align their product more closely with GOV.UK standards. We did this through 2 or 3 sessions where the product and delivery team talked us through their product and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir right fig-right" style="border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/kandinsky-notes.jpg" alt="People walking around and sharing their ideas artwork by Andrew Duckworth"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;ldquo;But doing it as a conscious way of adding value really does help grow design within your organisation. Just by letting teams experience it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if some of those people don&amp;rsquo;t directly lead to an ask for a designer. That&amp;rsquo;s a whole team of people who saw the value of it. And not in a theoretical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always a risk of course that though you show value you&amp;rsquo;ve made the value free. So why carve out some budget for a full-time designer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people who aren&amp;rsquo;t going to give you money aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna do it anyway. You&amp;rsquo;ve made something better. And you get to tell that story to everyone. And you can be clear on how often a team can ask for support if capacity is a worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the times I&amp;rsquo;ve jumped onto a project. Shown the value of design. And won the space for myself or others to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design community support is a great way to move people through their journey to trusting and learning how to use design. It&amp;rsquo;ll help you get people past awareness. And in places that design doesn&amp;rsquo;t always get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it won&amp;rsquo;t just happen. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to get out there and offer the opportunity. And create the space to it. But doing it as a conscious way of adding value really does help grow design within your organisation. Just by letting teams experience it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently been chatting with a former colleague and friend who is now working on a product I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They shared some of the challenges the team was working through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was interesting was that some of challenges were things we’d worked through way back in 2019. Classic sort of “know your API and data” type issues every good interaction or UX designer learns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that meant you have to make sure your designs are &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2019/12/05/design-for-real-data.html"&gt;based on real data&lt;/a&gt;. The screaming capitals style of real data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was interesting was that there wasn’t an active part of the team telling and teaching what we’d found out in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those lessons were no longer being carried across. And where we’d documented things, those lessons have been archived and no longer being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when an outside perspective is useful. To ask questions like “why does this api work like that?”. But a good team should be carrying forward that information and stories. Even between and after suppliers or other teams come and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because something didn’t work before, or there were limitations, doesn’t mean things can’t change. When looking at data and past decisions, you get to rethink or challenge things for the future. To tell the next chapter of how things work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the stories are no longer told, we waste money and time learning what we could have already known. Our research and design doesn’t get past the “so what?”. Or it does a lot later than it could have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no replacement for learning by doing. But it&amp;rsquo;s much more fun and valuable to learn new things. Rather than repeating the battles and lessons of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research and design team that forgets or fails to dig around what’s been learnt before is doomed to repeat the learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we avoid this? A good design process starts by digging around and learning what’s been learnt before. And what’s been done. In the enthusiasm for change or design it can be easily forgotten. Every designer has done this. And will do it again no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But reach out to those before. Or those who’ve done similar. Particularly on a product or service with many dependencies and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it easy to record and share your thinking. Make it easy to find your thinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make those that decide things aware that when they archive or remove the lessons and learning of the past they’ll be paying to repeat many of them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can influence how teams are put together. Make sure your team blends those that stick around and those that leave. Be they contractors, suppliers etc. Make sure you keep a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all. Do the design digging before you repeat the broken designs of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I was deep in the midst of working on covid-19 services. Of the major changing waves and pressures on the team I remember a period with an extreme focus on security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of delivery had dropped. It was still very high but there was a sudden change in atmosphere and shift from some new security people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tasks the new security people wanted to do was a &amp;ldquo;threat modelling exercise&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed interesting. Threat modelling is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A structured approach of identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system, and determining the value that potential mitigations would have in reducing or neutralizing those threats&amp;rdquo;
- &lt;a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html"&gt;OWASP Threat modelling Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team looks at the system/service they’re creating and thinks about all the ways it could be exploited or abused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s part “heuristic review”. Which is sort of an expert review by common rules or experience of the reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="right noir fig-right"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/lots of people.jpeg" alt="Lots of small sticky notes and people in boxes artwork by Andrew Duckworth"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;ldquo;Done right, it’s also a way of creating a narrative about highlighting the potential risks in poor experience. And the areas where mitigation and change is needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a user experience view, this interested me. There are lots of potential abuses of a service. As well as threats to a service. Security is one of those. But poor experience can do as much damage. Especially in clinical systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that seems a stretch, I know of a hospital where the way date of birth was shown was directly responsible for a chain of events that led to a death of a mother in birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of potential threats to your service. From malicious actors to accidents and mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario based workshop got me thinking of all the things that could impact a user’s experience. And importantly, how sustainable and useful the service would be to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done right, it’s also a way of creating a narrative about highlighting the potential risks in poor experience. And the areas where mitigation and change is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also help pinpoint things to get further user research and insight into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Running an experience modelling exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still playing with the right process. But here is what I’ve done so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Prep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get/Create a journey map or service map [journey + actors and systems underneath the journey to the user]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the people providing the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the people using the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the people who impact/influence those using the service [partners, kids, colleagues etc.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a list of people to involve in the review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure class="noir"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/service blueprint.png" alt="A service blueprint with lots of comments and notes on it"/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Any size or shape of a service blueprint or similar can do. Make it something people can follow along&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Workshop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get members of the team together to run through steps and scenarios in a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“subject matter experts”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people involved in running the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who have designed similar services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people with tech skills. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people without them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people from policy or governance teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For health services you will want clinicians too. You can also get people who use your services. In the NHS there are many ways of reaching patient representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decide the scope of the service you want to include. If it&amp;rsquo;s a change, you may want to focus on that journey more. But be careful to make sure it sits within a realistic context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your service is live. Do some groundwork to get data. Insights and visualise them alongside your journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workshop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief them about the goal. Unearthing the potential or known issues and outcomes of things going bad at each step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk them through a section of the service. If a large team, split into smaller groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get individuals to create notes on the potential ways a user could misunderstand, misuse or get each step wrong. If split into small groups, get the smaller groups to discuss and create more risks as a group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the room and walk through the steps articulating the risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rank the risks by likelihood and potential impact as a group. Voting if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to the next section of the service. Rinse repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve done either the part you want to cover, or the full service. You’ll now have a list of potential issues per step and the guessed likelihood and impact of those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have time you can then work out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deciding what to do next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you and the team struggled to represent your users. Do more research. Or involve them in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got lots of risks. And you feel the process was realistic. The next thing to do is to choose what to do with the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, whether to resolve, reduce, mitigate or accept a risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Resolve a risk by removing the possibility entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Take steps to reduce the likelihood of something bad happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigate damage&lt;/strong&gt; - Take steps to reduce the potential damage in a step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Accept it’s unlikely or impossible to stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve risk:&lt;/strong&gt;  don’t ask or save sensitive data so it can be leaked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce risk:&lt;/strong&gt;  ask for two factor verification, or check against a database so it’s less likely that someone can access information they shouldn’t &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigate damage:&lt;/strong&gt;  only display partial information. Like half a postcode. This way if it leaks the damage is limited &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept risk:&lt;/strong&gt;  Data is already public knowledge so don’t protect it. Or maybe a product replicates what’s happening in another product so accept this service would act in the same way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this step helps make clear what you can do. And ranking the likelihood and impact helps frame whether to invest in solutions that resolve risks. Or when to accept or reduce risk too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you do it with teams like security or clinical you can save yourself weeks and week of back and forth. And lots of misconceptions of each other&amp;rsquo;s perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re able to get teams like security involved in wider experience issues, you also get a good balance. Because risks are in context of journeys and likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this process with some clinicians and data folk for an elective care service. They wanted specific data items that would have been impossible for the users to know. Using the scenario approach, we could show them the burden it would create. And that they would stop any hospital staff from wanting to use the service. Which would be a bigger risk than the nice to have data items.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cathy Dutton asked if people have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cathy_dutton/status/1717540981526937636"&gt;any goto presentations on why we need to design forms&lt;/a&gt;. Not the process of how you do it. More the justification for it (other than it’s fun and gives me a job!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think of how I approach this. Or the battle that I can sense underneath. Which is justifying the cost of research and design and their impact. And in places where subject matter experts are &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to spend as little time justifying my or other people’s existence as specialists. Taking a show/watch me approach or using local examples of improvement or failure. But sometimes you’ve got to have those chats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was the &lt;a href="https://articles.centercentre.com/three_hund_million_button/"&gt;300 million button&lt;/a&gt; example. Though it took me a while to find it as I swore it was about airlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried looking on gov.uk and though I found a few. The gov.uk blogs are missing designers talking about making measurable impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do we design forms? And use specialists to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;Designers make sure policies, products and people are as successful as they can be&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s hard to complete a form then policies and products fail. Or make much less money or cost lots more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good designers make &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/2556288.2557265"&gt;forms better and quicker and easier to complete&lt;/a&gt;. And find ways of making improvements to processes. Like the &lt;a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/15/make-sure-this-is-right-a-new-email-confirmation-pattern/"&gt;register to vote team&lt;/a&gt; which improved how they captured emails helping 50,000 more people use the service each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly designers make things more profitable by looking at the small details. &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;amp;q=ux+form&amp;amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;amp;t=1698349420840&amp;amp;u=%23p%3DBjPQ7SL3NoIJ"&gt;Ebay made an additional $500 million a year just from redesigning a button&lt;/a&gt; on their mobile website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;Bad data undermines systems and businesses. Good form design reverses this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms are a key way that organisations get data and information. Be they credit card details to complete a transaction. Or an email or a newsletter sign up form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But poor data stymies and undermines systems and products. The implications of poor quality data means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have less user/customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased running costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inefficient decision-making processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lowered employee job satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/188448/1/v04-i02-p168_232-1425-1-PB.pdf"&gt;This interesting paper shows the evidence for this&lt;/a&gt;. The paper also highlights that bad data can have a revenue cost of 8-12% for many companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers work closely with data, policy and technical teams to improve the quality of data. They do this by making the processes clearer for the people filling in forms. Making it clear what is being asked of or shown to users in a form based journey. This skill means users enter in better data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;Good form design can reduce support costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expedia found out that the number one reason customers called them was to get their travel itineraries.  Their contact centre cost them over 100 million a year. Redesigning this reduced the need for support for this issue. Calls about this dropped from 58% to 15% (according to Medallia’s “Contact Center and Digital, Better Together”). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the information at the end of a process for the &lt;a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/21/improving-the-check-your-state-pension-service-in-public-beta/"&gt;State Pension team reduced enquiries by 51%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government spends millions every year in this support. A form stands in the way of them telling us things. Or getting access to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good design team makes it easier to input data. And makes the information and data forms return easier to understand and action. This leads to a reduction in calls, support and complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was part of a team that redesigned some paper forms that reduced the number and complexity of calls our contact centre got. The forms were built by subject matter experts but not design/form experts. Once we worked together we made it easier for our users to use our service. And reduced the cost to support the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;Bad forms request information we should already have or don&amp;rsquo;t need. Design looks to find ways to stop this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers make sure we don’t ask things we already know. At times for gov a statutory duty and if not, an efficiency and a way of ensuring validated data. Designers work with teams to understand why we are asking what we’re asking. And find other &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2019/03/18/do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-inclusive.html"&gt;options with lower risks or barriers for our users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing what you ask, because you already know if don&amp;rsquo;t need it, also helps people to complete forms. Formstack found that they could &lt;a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/contact-form-conversion-rate/"&gt;improve conversation rates by up to 160%&lt;/a&gt; by reducing how many things they asked for. If you ask for less because you use what you already have, you improve completion rates too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;Designers make sure our services and products meet their legal requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers help ensure that &lt;a href="https://blog.navapbc.com/structuring-a-complex-eligibility-form-for-healthcare-gov-37d79a5ad6?gi=12da7bf5ecf3"&gt;all people can use a service&lt;/a&gt;. Meeting people&amp;rsquo;s needs and making policies work first time and for all our communities. And by doing so meeting &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#:~:text=The%20accessibility%20regulations%20came%20into,accessibility%20statement%20on%20your%20website"&gt;legal and ethical standards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these technical requirements are open to interpretation. And need domain-knowledge to navigate and implement. Designers develop deep knowledge doing this and supporting teams in implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;Designers are experts at explaining and getting the right information in a form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="right fig-right"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/wireframes - andrew duckworth.jpeg" alt="Roy Litchenstien inspired artwork of UX wireframes"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your product or service has a form. It needs information. And it may also use that form to display data in a process or flow. Designers are experts at designing the form and how it sits within a journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do this so often they learn the rules and best practices and can ensure you follow them. So they can be quick and efficient by using best practice to improve things before you&amp;rsquo;ve invested in a solution and found out the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="h3"&gt;But what about low volume forms and transactions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because something is low volume doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the data or actions that sit off it are unimportant. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on forms where there are at best 100 submitted a year. But when they are completed the work to process and manage the request is really high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because designers come with lots of experience, they&amp;rsquo;re also well equipped to quickly help you pull together more generic forms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons you should still work with a designer are they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve data accuracy and quality through form submissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce support requests or the use of other channels to do the thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure legal compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use patterns to ensure people trust you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make things consistent with branding and your values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify or make sure of quick wins for usability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid costly revisions because things don&amp;rsquo;t work or increase workload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A form builder or design system will not give you these things. A team without a designer will find it harder to get this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good chunk of contact centre improvements I&amp;rsquo;ve made have started with poor data collection or bad processes that needed changing. And when teams look to design forms they also identify back office processes that need improving across the whole service. So you might start with the form but end up improving and optimising many processes and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why you design a form. For all these reasons. To make things easier for your user, get better data and meet your goals as an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A service I worked on from March is starting to roll out. When I landed in that team, needing some service design help and leadership, it felt they were the furthest away from making something real. And now it’s going to get very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all projects there’s lots to reflect on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you learnt. Could do better next time. Friendships and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that went well was the speed of getting up to speed and making an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the team when they had gotten a massive scope shift. With the team reeling a little. But a week after I joined we had an end to end service design and broad hypothesis for what we wanted the service to look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was lots more to do than that. But it felt great making an impact. And the feedback from the team and others was great too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a retro where some people were very nice about me and that impact it made me think about what helped me move things on. To make a useful impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having quite a lot of experience in health and the health and care sector helped. As did working in places learning how to do user centred design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same was also true to how data services work. Even if when I joined the project I wasn’t aware it was going to involve yet another data pipeline and dashboards project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if those things weren’t true. And there have been plenty of projects were they haven’t. A thing that seems to work is being happy to, being active, in putting myself at the heart of facilitating and running meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer in a senior or leading role, your job is to help teams make better decisions. To design the right thing or the thing right. A way to help the team to achieve that is through your craft. But there’s another way. And one particularly important for a service designer. Which is to facilitate and help people run their processes in a user-centred way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do that easier when you put yourself in the heart of the process. By offering to host, hold or run a meeting. From a retro to a planning session and everything in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/at the heart.jpeg" alt="Roy Lichtenstein style panel woman bluring into newspaper, hearts with empty speech bubble"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the project going live, I found myself running meetings from assumption mapping sessions to story mapping and sprint planning sessions. It ensured I was where decisions were made. And that when a decision was made. There was someone reflecting what users’ needed. And that we balanced lots of different perspectives and layers from the service. From policy, tech, users and service teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re feeling a little lost or out of the loop. Or want to make a bigger impact. Make a point of facilitating a meeting. Even a regular one or where there exists a person who sit in that role. It’ll help you be at the heart of things and facilitate the discussions and decisions you’ll need to do service design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your delivery, product or project manager aside and say you want to run something. Either as personal experience or to help mix something up. Whatever it takes. Put the effort in and design the meeting to make it a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally there’s a limit to what’s your role and be careful you’re not taking on work that’s not yours. Be clear you’re being helpful. And that this isn’t about taking notes or making coffee. It’s about making sure you and the team actually designs the service. So if the additional role doesn’t get you there be watchful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams or projects you may also find that the team is reluctant. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re still needing to buy the space to lead things. Sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s just because the team isn&amp;rsquo;t ready. Sometimes that means you need others to take that leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But. Remember that most of service design is orchestration and facilitation of multiple viewpoints consciously designing and making the service. And that happens outside the craft of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact the majority of service design happens outside the traditional craft of design. So don’t underestimate being at the heart of things. It’ll get you and your team further faster. Whatever way you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
