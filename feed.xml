    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a career full of great experiences of being managed and coached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with lots of brilliant people. But a good manager is not something I’ve commonly experienced. And when I have had good managers they weren’t in similar professions or did similar work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently leading and managing a team of 13. So when it’s come to trying to be a good manager there wasn’t a limitless well to go to of examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of what good management or coaching I’ve experienced, I have felt like people had time for me. And had my back. And this is something I want everyone to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have things like &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/01/08/kanban_for_interaction_design.html"&gt;Kanban boards&lt;/a&gt;, slack channels and weekly huddles. But the 1 to 1 has been the most useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about my experience of “being managed” in other teams, 1 to 1s often felt like boxes to tick. Or a scrambled meeting to be fit in very busy diaries. Or they are done so infrequently that there’s too much to say, so nothing valuable is said at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to and reading other people’s experiences of managing/being managed, something that was vital was the feeling that the time was important to the manager. That it was dedicated time. More important than the latest part of a service that was on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the experience I wanted for my team. Reflecting on how I wanted my team to feel about 1 to 1s with me, I wanted the team to feel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was engaged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That this time was more important than any other thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That I would be honest, realistic and open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That they could raise anything to me. Even about me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t just ask the question and expect the answers to flow. To get a process right, I made sure to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to others and look at people’s blogs about 1 to 1s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting with a few people then growing each week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in the process a way for the team to shape the agenda not me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some saved questions. So when something was asked or raised I had ways of coaching. And when nothing was directly raised I could check in on their work and happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a log of my meetings to see what worked and what did not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1 to 1s have been really rewarding. And important to unblocking issues and getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found out lots of new things about my team. And issues have been raised that wouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who I would have said weren’t ambitious or wanted to do more. Had raised hunger. Juniors who I thought wanted more experience in a particular role, wanted experience in another area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to my 1 to 1s with the team. And from the feedback I’ve got, they do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing or leading a team. Approach your 1 to 1 process like you would any design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t directly manage someone but have a position of seniority or leadership. Bring them in as part of your routine project work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to management. Start with 1 to 1s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 to 1s work if you do the work. Give them the focus they and your team deserve. And don’t be afraid to get things wrong and the change them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Related stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I read that were useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/"&gt;101 questions to ask in 1 to 1s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/servant-leadership/be-a-manager-3b0e39d87179"&gt;Be a manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tosin and Henry from the &lt;a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/"&gt;NHS service manual team&lt;/a&gt; shared their recent work at last Thursday’s design huddle &lt;a href="#link-1" id=link-1-ref&gt;&lt;span hidden&gt;Link to explanation of design huddles &lt;/span&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. They covered their work on understanding and improving contributions to the service manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They shared some of their research. Talking about reasons people don’t contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons were time, not knowing what &lt;em&gt;contributing&lt;/em&gt; meant and how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason revealed after was a feeling that the service manual was “put together by experts”. People feel intimidated. By the manual and from contributing. And that components/patterns were untouchable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matched something I had been thinking about recently. That the level of authority and professionalism in a design system helps sell it so teams use it. But increases the perception things are fixed. Done. And not open to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shouldn’t be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more professional and finished something is, the less likely people are to add to it. Maybe a typo here and there. This happens with prototypes all the time. The more polished something is, you reduce the type of feedback you get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do get more fundamental feedback. It’s often a total rejection. Rather than an iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you present something less polished, you get more radical feedback. Feedback that feeds on an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental tension for any service manual and design system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with the service manual is, to get people using it. You need to express the same sort of authority and completeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t sell a design system with a sense of things not being thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doing so you also create a barrier for contribution. Because things look complete. Done. And done by “experts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost an impossible task. But every design system has to balance polish that sells implementation with openness to new ideas. And a sense that components or patterns aren’t final. They’re open to iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to seeing how the NHS service manual team tackle that balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own or feed into a design system. Make sure there’s a sense of openness to change. Be okay to give openness to feedback higher prominence. And show how things are in a state of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And make sure you do the hard work to dispel that a design system is only created by design system experts. It&amp;rsquo;s created and improved by any and every team that uses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let your design system seem complete&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#link-1-ref" id=link-1&gt;&lt;span hidden&gt;Link back to body of text &lt;/span&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; The design huddle is an hour where all designers from NHS Digital get together and share their work or ask for help&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched a lot of service designers working in programmes and projects where they’re fighting against the tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing that every single day, it&amp;rsquo;s terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been very lucky to enjoy the space to do design. And though it’s tempting to think I’m super awesome, something that’s important is winning the space to design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different things can win you the space to do design. From senior buy-in, making the impossible seem possible, to getting stuff made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the reality of senior buy-in, I find that making immediate and visible impact on the frontend of a service is a key building block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redesigning a form. Paper or otherwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating prototypes that become working code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions/tweaks to problems identified in live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping explain issues the business or user encounters in live &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A service designer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be the one to do this work. Though it helps to build trust in a designer. It’s okay to benefit from other people doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s nothing that sells the value of designers in a room than things like making a transaction less rubbish. Giving a better shape to a product than when no designer was involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I’m a big fan of is the &lt;a href="https://danskdesigncenter.dk/en/design-ladder-four-steps-design-use"&gt;“Danish Design Centre’s design ladder”&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a model for explaining how companies use design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From not doing it, to it being a form giving act to it shaping strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing is to remember that where an organisation, programme or project is, isn’t fixed. And every success can be exploited to get design involved earlier. And more thoughtfully and completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you find yourself swimming against the tide. Try a smaller scope. A more focused place to make changes. Not every team will be sold on doing things differently. And sometimes that means taking a longer path by starting with the forms. Even if you want to start with strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know, your users will thank you. It’s a great place to start. And it’ll help you guide the project to doing other things too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a product/interaction designer. Don’t be afraid to keep pushing to be involved in more. Going beyond just form giving. If you’re a service designer. Don’t be afraid to start in the product and take a team on a journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost count of the projects where I joined to help with a website or form and ended changing how a service was delivered or organisation was structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win the space to design services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A common mistake teams make is designing for a context their users don't have</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Under time pressure it’s easy to design a service that works for those that understand a problem. But not those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last week or so a team released a question in a service that made sense to people who were doing something daily. But, how the question was written meant that people who did it once a week thought it applied to them. It did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team were working under intense pressure. And getting a true outside perspective was hard. They lost sight of the fact that the large majority of the service’s users wouldn’t know the context of their work. Their policy and their question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People answered wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to make this mistake. We&amp;rsquo;ve all made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be many ways a team develops this blindspot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overconfidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last minute changes to scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrictions who you can talk to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User research only with users with knowledge of a policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few questions you can ask yourself or your team to try and guard against making this mistake. Such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this service used by people who don’t need to see this question/feature? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What number of people will understand this question? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this question or flow cater to the majority or a minority of journeys?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is how we are wording a question presume a certain knowledge? And is that knowledge going to be common amongst our users? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tasked with rapidly adding an important new journey or new feature it can be easy to give the new thing massive prominence. But new does not mean it’s something that the majority will use. Nor understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, explore your new feature or question with those that understand. And those that don’t. Your biggest issues will always come from those that don’t understand. From those who don’t match the context you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least ask yourself, is this a feature or question something that the majority will know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is not, try to restrict who sees it. Or guard the question by optimising for the 80% journey. Not the minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand if your design works for those without context.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The most common improvement I tell teams to make is to tell the user what they need to do in the h1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your h1 will be one of the first things that a user reads. It frames the whole page and everything inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though teams know this, I often see the most important thing buried in a paragraph somewhere else. Or in some colourful box trying to compete against the h1 for attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than competing against your h1 by using callout boxes. Let your heading do the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a service is unavailable, or no results were found, put that in the h1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beyond questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you only have one question on the page, it can be easier for teams to be clear what the user needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why &lt;a href="/2019/01/31/one-thing.html"&gt;doing one thing per page&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier to be clear to your user what they need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen many teams have a h1 that is different to the question and input on a page. If you find yourself doing this. Make the h1 the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you need to provide several options. Or more information to support a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re not writing a heading as a question. Use a verb in your heading to help the user know what you&amp;rsquo;re asking them to do. For example check, enter, tell, select or choose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this makes it clear that you want the users to do something. And what it is that you want them to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;rsquo;t want the user to do something, but need them to know something. Make the h1 tell the main story. Do not bury the important details. Tell them their message has been sent, appointment cancelled or that you have refunded them £6.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t make your h1 compete with the important details. Make it &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; important thing. And never leave the user guessing that you want them to do a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your headings do the hard work&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working in a team it’s important to find a way of having presence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to think presence is about being around a lot. Always connected or online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not. It’s you and your team having a sense of each other. And what you’re up to. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence can be being online together. But presence can also be silent. And a feeling of connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong presence can be a hard won thing but it’s built through simple things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear communication when you’re heads down, not around or what you’re tackling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s doing the work to make your efforts open and collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’s most simple it’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making clear what you’re tackling that day or week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telling people when you’re around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being clear on what you can handle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for help or a second opinion. And willing to offer a second opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking up when things aren’t clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to say why you’ve done what you’ve done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being clear why you&amp;rsquo;ve done what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be daunting to make yourself heard and your boundaries obvious as a junior colleague. My advice is always start with when you’re around or not. And the rest can follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not have to be available all day and at every hour. Nor do you need to have your camera on and always be on a call to have presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now that’s the biggest mistake teams are making. The need to always be online to get a sense of presence. But meeting notes written up, a prototype or a question in a thread will do much more for your team’s presence. Your team’s ability to sense what each other is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presence is just a sense that people know you’re around and what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be clear on what you’re tackling. When you’re around or not. Find a way of having presence&lt;/p&gt;
