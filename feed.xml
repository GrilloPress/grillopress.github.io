    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a year ago a designer helped fill in for a couple of weeks when I was on leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They mentioned that one of the development teams I worked with didn&amp;rsquo;t know some design thinking terminology, and it surprised them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially as I worked with them for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from inspiring some mild imposter syndrome, it got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like to do is make teams know the outcomes we&amp;rsquo;re trying to create. And the problems we&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s why I do &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2017/12/10/hypothesis-driven-design.html"&gt;hypothesis driven design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a difference between working in the right way and dictating the exact words and ways we explain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about finding the right words to help each other understand how to get to a solution. Or what&amp;rsquo;s blocking one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From colleagues to stakeholders to users. You have to lean on commonly understood things. As well as what the people you&amp;rsquo;re working with say and label things as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to use &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/12/19/trying-a-new-format-for-hypotheses.html"&gt;a set format for hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; and I use this to document my work. And when I get my work reviewed by colleagues I tend to talk through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about hypothesis driven design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than talking about double diamonds, design thinking and hypotheses. It&amp;rsquo;s important to start by using the words and concepts of the team or individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a time and a place to introduce new things. But no one wants to be lectured at. Find the right words to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a fair amount of time doing discoveries in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some better than others. And I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that helps frame discoveries better is &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2019/10/08/make-it-about-a-decision.html"&gt;shaping them around a decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this well it’s best to kick off your discoveries with an “inception” meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inception is a project kickoff session.  Everyone who is part of the discovery team should be there. As well as any decision maker or stakeholder too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting helps you define the right scope and what you need to go find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A format for an inception that has worked for me and other teams I&amp;rsquo;ve helped is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a discovery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What problem or task have we been given?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our discovery is to decide [x]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make that decision, we need to know what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we do to find out what we need to know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This format helps get your team focused on the right things. And gives you the space to define what decision you&amp;rsquo;re going to tackle. As well as the steps you&amp;rsquo;re going to take to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a shared understanding of what decision you’re helping make. Or of what you need to do to support that decision, it’s nearly impossible to do any project justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No discovery should start without understanding what issue you&amp;rsquo;re exploring. Nor should they continue without you understanding what decision you are helping make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After defining the policy intent or issue to a decision you should discuss as a team what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what a team needs to know is the most important part. This can range from &amp;ldquo;who are our users&amp;rdquo; to more specific technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you only have an hour together, you should spend half your time talking through what you know. And what you need to find out. As well as prioritising what to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve defined as a group what you want to find out, you can define some activities you&amp;rsquo;ll likely do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part might be flexible. But it helps push forward your team from things to find out, to what we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Continuous inception&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to only do this sort of activity at the start of project either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last summer I joined a discovery project several weeks in and struggled a little with the scope. By resetting it with the whole team I caught up but the team could also pivot on what they’d already found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That meeting shaped the next few weeks and helped us come to a different, better decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your discovery going by setting the direction. By starting, or restarting, it right.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking at solving a big problem or a part of a product or service that isn&amp;rsquo;t performing, discoveries are a key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discoveries are intense periods of learning and exploring. They help you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;question what opportunities there are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what issues your users are facing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what problems you should try to solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can last weeks or months. And you can even chain several together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of every good discovery is a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a service or not. To pursue a solution. To prioritise a problem or not. To go forward with a piece of work or not. To solve an issue in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working from a decision it&amp;rsquo;s easier for a team to know what to do. What sort of evidence they need. And what level of confidence they should be comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on a decision also gives talented teams space. If you&amp;rsquo;re deciding to build a service or not, a &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; may also highlight what should be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a team is told to build a thing or deliver a feature, making the first step a discovery and a decision means the team can carve the space to do the work to choose if the direction is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framing discoveries as a decision helps transfer power to the team on the ground. Which will help deliver the outcomes behind any ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;ve made a discovery about a decision, what to do has always been clearer. And speaking truth to power easier, because that was the outcome agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your next period of intense research and design about a decision.  It&amp;rsquo;ll help give you space to do your best work. And deliver better outcomes for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to get caught up in a furious cycle of design research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy is delivery. And delivery puts pressure on to test your designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;re developing a service against tight deadlines or with a large team, that can mean testing a lot. Of things, ideas and changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the alternative being not testing things. Or not challenging designs, the pressure is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can find yourself sucked into a rapid cycle of testing session after session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to find yourselves designing in small incremental steps. And not making big iterative changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to vary your pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask any developer and they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you the times they&amp;rsquo;ve spent hours failing to solve a problem. Only to solve it in minutes the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s better to give yourself some time. And challenge things with larger iterative designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ve got to let it breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working in the open makes your work better. But getting better often means hard, humbling work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your good intentions will be mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your openness will be taken as if you&amp;rsquo;ve got the answers to everything. Even when you&amp;rsquo;re asking for feedback and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be challenging current ways of working. And taking responsibility for things way beyond your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your process will easily be missed. And people will feel your work threatens or misunderstands other people&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your design&amp;rsquo;s flaws will be exposed to fresh air (whether you like it or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But. Your work will be all the better. And working in the open will help others do so too. Because people will feel they can too. And because responses to your work will give the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much of the feedback you get, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel positive, will be done with love. And admiration for your efforts and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when it isn&amp;rsquo;t. The challenge is where you grow the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt. Growing as a designer is hard, humbling work. Does it need to be so tough? No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts less when you make your work open earlier. You&amp;rsquo;re less attached to your design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts less when you&amp;rsquo;re sharing your work often. And it hurts less when you &lt;a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2019/06/10/make-things-open.html"&gt;find a way to work openly which fits you and where your work is at&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts less when you include others in your process. And make your process open and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts less when everyone else is working openly too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts less when we&amp;rsquo;re all supportive and constructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it easier for yourself and others to work in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last week or so, Sam has written the opt-out service’s accessibility statement. An accessibility statement is a page that explains what accessibility testing you&amp;rsquo;ve done. And any defects you are working through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of working in the open and being open about your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When planning the work Sam and myself said the definition of done should be to open up our work to our colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as part of the acceptance criteria we agreed that we’d share the statement on slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Working in the open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing the statement we made a point of being open. Getting help from several places through our entire process. We had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the full policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asked the UK Government slack community what they were doing. And to check my understanding of the policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looked through an early access version of the GDS template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Held a design meet up about it to discuss as designers what we were doing and our position on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aligned our work with what our colleagues around NHS Digital and GDS were doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talked the delivery team through the design decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had also leant on the expertise of users with access needs through our testing partner DAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sam had finished writing the accessibility statement she shared it on slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Opportunities to be open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the principles I love is &amp;ldquo;make things open, it makes things better&amp;rdquo;. I see it as a ways of working principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many opportunities to be open about your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using baking a cake as an example there are many stages you can be open:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m hungry, what should I eat? &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; I have these ingredients, what should I cook?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m thinking about cooking a cake. What cake should I cook?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m making this cake, any advice? &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; Would you like to do it with me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m cooking a cake, does this look right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve cooked my cake, what do you think? (Would you like a slice?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My cakes are very dense, what could I do that&amp;rsquo;s different?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here’s what I did to cook that cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is every opportunity to be open with your work. Be it with your team, or those beyond it. Choose an opportunity. It may not be as delicious as cake, but working in the open makes your work better.&lt;/p&gt;
