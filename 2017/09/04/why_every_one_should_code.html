tl;dr I fall within the “yes you should learn to code” camp. I do so because it has both immediate and related benefits to everyone and computer science itself.
</p>
<h2>
Reasons to think everyone should learn to code…
</h2>
<h3>
Great developers can come from everywhere
</h3>
<p>
There are countless good and great developers and computer scientists who’ve come from a variety of backgrounds, not just a comp-sci background, that it is possible that anyone could pick it up and be good at it. Stepping outside of computer science, think of art as a discipline. Not every great artist was classically trained. Not every classically trained artist was great. Henri Matisse came to painting after getting a job at a bank (I’m sure there are better examples, an accomplished art historian, I am not!).
</p>
<p>
So, for you all you know, you could be a great developer. Or your friend or relative  or whoever.
</p>
<p>
And for the good of computer science, it is worth encouraging everyone to get involved. If a great developer etc. can come from anywhere, the more we encourage people to dip their toe, the greater the chance we have on finding that Matisse.
</p>
<h3>
Learning to code, like other crafts, can teach you something about yourself
</h3>
<p>
I’m a big fan of the notion that learning/doing things provides the room to improve as a person as well as space to learn about yourself. Coding is hard. Coding brings up problems. Hitting adversity and how to deal with that, teaches you things. I think this has made me a better person and better at creating and sourcing solutions (never mind improving my google-fu).
</p>
<p>
It has also exposed some things I don’t like about myself. I pride myself on being a problem solver, but sometimes I can be a problem avoider. This is sometimes a virtue (like NOT saying something when someone isn’t ready to hear it) but it can also be a vice (not saying anything at all, even when those thoughts could help the person in the long run). Learning to code exposed this to me. This has/will no doubt make me a better person. More aware.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t necessarily a benefit of learning to code that is integral to it, but like many crafts it constantly provides roadblocks (and unlike gardening, starting from scratch is just a remove directory command not four days back-breaking work!) and roadblocks have the chance of offering the chance to develop as a person.
</p>
<h3>
Learning to code is a tangible benefit
</h3>
<p>
In terms of more direct benefits of learning to code, it can provide you with concrete problem solving skills. A person I used to work with used to say “learning computer science changed how I solved problems”. They meant that since learning to code, they approached issues in a more systematic and structured methodology.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if you learn to code and want to create something interesting (like an app that latches onto a moment in time) then you are able to do so. You have the ability to talk and tell a computer how exactly how to do something you want.
</p>
<p>
But more than the ability to think in more logical ways or to express yourself and your imagination, you can make a damn fine stab at a career with coding. You can earn serious money even without being in the top 1% of your industry.
</p>
<p>
From prototyping designs, creating scripts for spreadsheets, designing simple plugins for CMSes, to building highly available, distributed systems, coding can give you an extraordinary career. It pays really well, offers a massive range of roles that fit skill and personality types as well as work from home and start-up/entrepreneur possibilities. Coding/programming may have many issues and sins as an industry (which industry doesn’t?), but it does offer amazing opportunities.
</p>
<h2>
But not EVERYONE is going to be good at it!
</h2>
<p>
And that is fine. Not everyone is good at gardening, painting or pottery but I doubt we’d discuss whether anyone should give those activities a try.
</p>
<p>
Everyone should give coding a try. It has many tangible and intangible benefits.  Many people can make a living from it. Some people will be quite good at it. A few may even be great and make great things!
</p>
<p>
If you fail, try again or try something else.
