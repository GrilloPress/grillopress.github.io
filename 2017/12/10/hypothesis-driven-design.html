<p>It's important as a designer to be able to explain everything about your design. The intent, constraints, trade-offs and how a design should be evaluated.</p>
<p>In a product team, it is also vital everyone understands the design.</p>
<p>Your colleagues should be able to explain the thinking behind your product's design. Not in minute detail, but in broad strokes.</p>
<p>Hypothesis driven design is a method to achieve this.</p>
<p>Hypothesis driven design is a process where you state what outcomes you expect from a design. You write short statements that state your position and the outcome you expect from a change.</p>
<p>Hypotheses can be big or small. They are statements that can cover small changes or additions like using breadcrumbs. Or a wider user need or story.</p>
<h2>Hypothesis as the articulation of intent</h2>
<p>A hypothesis is a statement. A statement of your current understanding and what change you expect to see. A hypothesis is an articulation of your intent.</p>
<p>A sentence or two where you describe what will happen if you add breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Your hypotheses exist to communicate your thinking. As well as letting you and others test it. To verify it.</p>
<p>If we expect a certain user outcome if we add breadcrumbs, is this the best way to do that? If we expect a certain outcome, did that happen when we tested it?</p>
<p>A good hypothesis is testable and verifiable. It can be true or false.</p>
<p>In the team I work in at NHS Digital, we write our hypotheses using a formal language. We use:</p>
<ul class='list-unstyled'>
<li>[Context]</li>
<li>If [some action]</li>
<li>Then [outcome for users]</li>
<li>Because [reason for outcome]</li>
</ul>
<p>The context let's us frame why we are trying to solve a particular problem. We found this made writing easier. It also made them easier to understand when we returned to them.</p>
<p>Your context could come from data. A hunch. A user lab. Other people. Or a mixture.</p>
<p>An example could be:</p>
<p>'In lab 6 users struggled to navigate between pages. No user used the native browser back button. The researcher had to intervene to return to the homepage".</p>
<p>The rest of the statement frames what we are going to do, what impact that'll have on the user and why.</p>
<p>One line suffices for each.</p>
<p>Writing these statements surfaces your reasoning behind your design decisions. It makes you a better designer. It acts as documentation. It helps you communicate the intent behind your design.</p>
<h2>Where our statements live</h2>
<p>We use a Kanban board to track our design work. We write our hypotheses as our design work matures.</p>
<p>We then attach the hypothesis statements as comments to our cards in Jira.</p>
<p>Before any design artefact is given to a developer or tested, it must have a hypothesis attached to it.</p>
<p>When we review our design work, we review the hypothesis.</p>
<p>The prototypes we build are a collection of hypotheses. Some proven, some not. When we test our prototype with users, we see if our expectations are true or not.</p>
<p>In six to twelve months time, we'll know why we added breadcrumbs and the context that led to that decision.</p>
<h2>The benefits of using hypothesis driven design</h2>
<p>Hypothesis driven design is a simple process where you articulate your intent. The expected outcomes from your design work.</p>
<p>Writing design hypotheses isn't always pleasurable. It can be tough to get them exactly right. But they make you a better designer.</p>
<p>The act of articulating your design choice further refines your design.</p>
<p>By using this process you:</p>
<ol id='benefits-of-hypothesis-driven-design'>
<li>Articulate your thinking</li>
<li>Provide others with understanding of your thinking</li>
<li>Create a framework to test your designs against</li>
<li>Develop a standard way of documenting your work</li>
<li>Make better stuff</li>
</ol>
