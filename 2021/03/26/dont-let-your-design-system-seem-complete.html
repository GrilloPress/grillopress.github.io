            <p>Tosin and Henry from the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/">NHS service manual team</a> shared their recent work at last Thursday’s design huddle <a href="#link-1" id="link-1-ref"><span hidden="">Link to explanation of design huddles </span>[1]</a>. They covered their work on understanding and improving contributions to the service manual.</p>

<p>They shared some of their research. Talking about reasons people don’t contribute.</p>

<p>Some of the reasons were time, not knowing what contributing meant and how to do it.</p>

<p>Another reason revealed after was a feeling that the service manual was “put together by experts”. People feel intimidated. By the manual and from contributing. And that components/patterns were untouchable.</p>

<p>This matched something I had been thinking about recently. That the level of authority and professionalism in a design system helps sell it so teams use it. But increases the perception things are fixed. Done. And not open to change.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t be a surprise.</p>

<p>The more professional and finished something is, the less likely people are to add to it. Maybe a typo here and there. This happens with prototypes all the time. The more polished something is, you reduce the type of feedback you get.</p>

<p>If you do get more fundamental feedback. It’s often a total rejection. Rather than an iteration.</p>

<p>But when you present something less polished, you get more radical feedback. Feedback that feeds on an idea.</p>

<p>This is a fundamental tension for any service manual and design system.</p>

<p>The issue with the service manual is, to get people using it. You need to express the same sort of authority and completeness.</p>

<p>You don’t sell a design system with a sense of things not being thought of.</p>

<p>But doing so you also create a barrier for contribution. Because things look complete. Done. And done by “experts”.</p>

<p>It’s almost an impossible task. But every design system has to balance polish that sells implementation with openness to new ideas. And a sense that components or patterns aren’t final. They’re open to iteration.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to seeing how the NHS service manual team tackle that balance.</p>

<p>If you own or feed into a design system. Make sure there’s a sense of openness to change. Be okay to give openness to feedback higher prominence. And show how things are in a state of development.</p>

<p>And make sure you do the hard work to dispel that a design system is only created by design system experts. It’s created and improved by any and every team that uses it.</p>

<p>Don’t let your design system seem complete</p>
