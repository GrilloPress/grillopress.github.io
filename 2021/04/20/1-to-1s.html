            <p>I haven’t had a career full of great experiences of being managed and coached.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with lots of brilliant people. But a good manager is not something I’ve commonly experienced. And when I have had good managers they weren’t in similar professions or did similar work.</p>

<p>I’m currently leading and managing a team of 13. So when it’s come to trying to be a good manager there wasn’t a limitless well to go to of examples.</p>

<p>Of what good management or coaching I’ve experienced, I have felt like people had time for me. And had my back. And this is something I want everyone to feel.</p>

<p>We have things like <a href="https://grillopress.github.io/2018/01/08/kanban_for_interaction_design.html">Kanban boards</a>, slack channels and weekly huddles. But the 1 to 1 has been the most useful tool.</p>

<p>Thinking about my experience of “being managed” in other teams, 1 to 1s often felt like boxes to tick. Or a scrambled meeting to be fit in very busy diaries. Or they are done so infrequently that there’s too much to say, so nothing valuable is said at all.</p>

<p>Talking to and reading other people’s experiences of managing/being managed, something that was vital was the feeling that the time was important to the manager. That it was dedicated time. More important than the latest part of a service that was on fire.</p>

<p>This is the experience I wanted for my team. Reflecting on how I wanted my team to feel about 1 to 1s with me, I wanted the team to feel:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was engaged</li>
<li>That this time was more important than any other thing</li>
<li>That I would be honest, realistic and open</li>
<li>That they could raise anything to me. Even about me</li>
</ul>

<p>But you can’t just ask the question and expect the answers to flow. To get a process right, I made sure to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talk to others and look at people’s blogs about 1 to 1s</li>
<li>Starting with a few people then growing each week</li>
<li>Build in the process a way for the team to shape the agenda not me</li>
<li>Have some saved questions. So when something was asked or raised I had ways of coaching. And when nothing was directly raised I could check in on their work and happiness</li>
<li>Write a log of my meetings to see what worked and what did not</li>
</ul>

<p>The 1 to 1s have been really rewarding. And important to unblocking issues and getting things done.</p>

<p>I have found out lots of new things about my team. And issues have been raised that wouldn’t have.</p>

<p>People who I would have said weren’t ambitious or wanted to do more. Had raised hunger. Juniors who I thought wanted more experience in a particular role, wanted experience in another area.</p>

<p>I look forward to my 1 to 1s with the team. And from the feedback I’ve got, they do too.</p>

<p>If you’re managing or leading a team. Approach your 1 to 1 process like you would any design.</p>

<p>If you don’t directly manage someone but have a position of seniority or leadership. Bring them in as part of your routine project work.</p>

<p>If you’re new to management. Start with 1 to 1s.</p>

<p>1 to 1s work if you do the work. Give them the focus they and your team deserve. And don’t be afraid to get things wrong and the change them.</p>
